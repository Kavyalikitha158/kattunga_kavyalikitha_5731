Best movie ever!michalberanek20 July 2023I saw many movies during my life but not one was for me good enough to write an Imbd review. This movie has everything a good movie must have and even more than that. It is a biopic as great as it could be and mostly even historically correct. But for me a citizen of Eastern Europe it also has an essence of understanding of the great danger that the atomic bomb is. The movie uses no CGI and show real explositions of bombs and it is better than what any CGI could make. It is also very philosophical in its thinking about the threat that the bombs make. But most importantly the actors from the main Cillian Murphy to others like Emily Blunt and Robert Downey jr. Are all just as wonderful as they could be. This movie is a masterpiece and a must-see.3 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Fully told storyadamgontarz21 July 2023There were awesome 3 hours in cinema. Although the film was so long, it was passing quickly, sometimes too quickly. Because of short shots, some quotes or events might not be fully captured by the audience.From the technical point of view, Oppenheimer is as great as different Christopher Nolan's movies. Thrilling soundtrack and excellent cinematography affect the viewers.Directing, in the most important moments, is outstanding and impressive.Cillian Murphy played his best in this movie.From supporting roles, the best one was Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss. He was really charismatic in his problematic role.I think female characters weren't used well. They weren't very important to the story.For me, the biggest positive surprise was screenplay and storytelling. Most of the characters were developed. The story provided emotions. Also, relations of scientists with army and politicians were well written. There were some brilliant ironic scenes about it.One of the best Nolan's works, I recommend to everyone.2 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I did not expect to not love this filmpostman1071621 July 2023Oppenheimer while a solid film is not what I expected.I'll start with the great. The performances especially Robert Downey Jr are off the chart. Emily Blunt has an absolute masterful scene. Cillian Murphy is very good as Oppie.The good. It's an interesting film that FEELS important. It's shot well of course. Many of the scenes hold your interest.The rest: it's too long... and for no reason. It's 3 separate films poorly edited into a mismatched formal outfit. Additionally, the sound mix fails miserably. The big moments are big; however, the dialogue is often missed at crucial moments of the film making the through line difficult to follow.It feels like a film that wants to be Oliver Stone's JFK; but, fails to have an underlying story interesting enough to justify the black and white and odd cut backs. The atom bomb is a sideline to the story unlike every ad campaign which makes it the primary focus. By the time we TEST the bomb (considering we don't see anything of Hiroshima or Nagasaki) we are left with another hour of the same beat over and over and over in a claustrophobic coat closet of a conference room with 2 dimensional characters including Oppenheimer himself for every single scene in the room or similar 2 dimensional congressional hearing members droning on about whether Downey (who is brilliant) should be confirmed for a cabinet position.I wanted to love this film but it's just another big budget effort that fails to meet expectations.13 out of 23 found this helpful.

"Overwhelming, powerful and emphatic, a film that stays with youPotassiumMan23 July 2023Christopher Nolan's grandly ambitious film about J. Robert Oppenheimer takes on incredible dimensions such that it reaches beyond the contours of the typical Hollywood biopic. This film is also a retelling of America's desperate effort during WW2 to successfully construct a nuclear bomb before the Nazis could. It's also a sobering depiction of America's intense paranoia toward alleged communist sympathizers during the Cold War and beforehand. On both fronts, Nolan's portrayal is remarkably effective.Cillian Murphy gives the best performance of his career thus far as the utterly determined scientist whose brilliance was able to overcome his incidental flaws as a husband, coworker and government mercenary. We see the world at the dawn of startling change through his quietly terrified eyes. It's a magnificent breakthrough for science but for humanity, a new age of fear and uncertainty and Murphy's performance is the guiding hand. Strong supporting performances abound. Emily Blunt is effective as the thick-skinned wife. Matt Damon is the straight-talking Lt. General Leslie Groves who oversaw the Manhattan Project. Robert Downey Jr. Plays against type as Lewis Strauss, a founding member of the Atomic Energy Commission whose working relationship with Oppenheimer turns into a point of contention later in the film.The film's emotional high points are toward the end after a very early preview of the psychological turmoil that Oppenheimer goes through in comprehending the ramifications for humanity in the wake of his miraculous breakthrough. Without going into too much detail, it's a portrayal of the pitfalls of genius and immense responsibility. You leave with gratitude and humility for this part of history as a lesson but also as a cautionary tale on whom you can trust. Whether you watch as a film buff, a history buff or someone with a science background, it's a rare, rewarding film experience. A superb achievement and highly recommended.2 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"LEGENDARYpaze-8476520 July 2023Nolan has succeeded to create a different cinematic expirience. An unconventional one.It is the new definition of a SPECTACLE. I was just hooked for 3 hours.It's caused me to feel a lot of different feelings. But at the end of it, I was just speechless.My friends were all talking about what they liked or didn't like, and then they asked me what I think about it, and all I could say is ""I don't know""I'm relatively new Nolan fan, so I feel greatfull to get to see a true Nolan spectacle in cinema.I've seen TENET in cinema, and liked it a lot.

"It's a Nolan Masterclass: Phenomenal performances across the board, the harrowing truth of one of humanity's most brilliant and yet deadly discovery!atharvakokaje21 July 2023Absolutely loved the Movie from start to finish!It felt as if I was truly transported back to the 1930s and 40s. Great character and costume design. The casting of this epic has been magnificent. The writing is very powerful and symbolic. For a student of science like me, watching these big names of Physics being mentioned and used as plot points was really cool.The sheer elegance of the way Cilian Murphy portrays the scientist whose other worldly genius is almost tormenting his soul is truly an Oscar worthy performance. Known for his famous soulless stare in the Peaky Blinders, Cilian Murphy's Oppenheimer stare feels ached, his eyes act to convey the incredible inner turmoil this man has endured.Another performance I would love to single out is Robert Downey Jr, he is phenomenal as Lewis Strauss. His nuanced performance certainly deserves an Oscar nomination at the least.Matt Damon and Rami Malek are great in their respective parts. At times I had trouble reminding myself that it's not General Groves, it's Matt Damon!Nolan's direction shines through it all . With the use of practical special effects and low CGI, the movie seems a bit too realistic at times. The victories, the losses and the betrayals feel all too personal. Nolan's use of B&W to denote seperate times and contexts feels brilliant. The background score is beautiful and haunting at the same time.It's not all roses sadly, it feels like a lot of info crammed into 3 hours. Felt like it could have been a 2 part series. The nonlinear story telling maybe offputting to many. Oppenheimer's final fate is not touched upon. At least a small infographic in the end showing ""where they are now/what happened to them"" would've helped a lot.All in all, a solid film to watch for any movie enthusiast!5 out of 9 found this helpful.

"One of the best films of 2023dakotadickenson-8345721 July 2023Oppenheimer is the first film to come from Christopher Nolan's new journey in filmmaking by switching it up a bit to make probably one of the best biopics in the past decade. The story follows J. Robert Oppenheimer on a mission to help develop the atomic bomb that will affect the world as we know it, while also showing us the political dilemma that is caused by it, as well as the affect it has on himself and others close to him. Cillian Murphy as the title character J. Robert Oppenheimer gives probably the best performance of his career as well as one of the best performances of the year and I'm glad that Christopher Nolan finally gives him his time to shine after taking a backseat in Nolan's previous films throughout the years. Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer I thought fit her role well, although I wished we could of explored her character a bit more. Matt Damon as General Leslie Grooves Jr is a great addition to the supporting cast and is one of the best characters of the movie. Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss absolutely nails his role and also gives a great supporting performance in this film. Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock was also great, although I felt her role in the film was to be more absurd with Oppenheimer rather than supporting of him like I thought her character would be and I figured her character would of played a bigger role than what was anticipated, but overall, she was fantastic as always. The score for this film is probably one of the best scores I've heard since Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008) and the actual atomic bomb scene was incredible to watch. I also like how Christopher Nolan was able to give audiences insight and show how dangerous a atomic bomb can be and the affect it has on people. If there's any cons I have, the way sexuality/nudity is handled is a bit strange, but also I can see why it's handled that way and the third act starts to drag a bit, but other than that, there's not really much to complain about. Overall, Oppenheimer is not only probably one of the best films of 2023, but also one of the best biopics in the last decade that will be revisited for years to come.5 out of 15 found this helpful.

"Oppenheimer"" takes you on a guilt trip through the mind of a scientist.saikirandubbakka27 July 2023I just had to share my thoughts on ""Oppenheimer."" In my opinion, it is hands down the best film of 2023 so far, truly ending the first half of the year with a bang. For the past three months, I've been yearning for some quality content, but most movies have been either too commercial or just plain lackluster.The wait for ""Oppenheimer"" was completely worthwhile, and I won't spoil the plot for you in this review. It's a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer, but what sets it apart is Christopher Nolan's exceptional treatment of the subject matter. This is far from a popcorn flick; it delves deep into character study, making you feel like you're inside Oppenheimer's head, experiencing what he goes through. It's a guilt trip for a scientist who created something that changed the world forever and how we are at fingertip/button away from explosion.I must say, Nolan outdid himself in many scenes, making this, in my opinion, his best work as a director to date. The second half, especially after the trinity test, had some of my favorite moments, with the court drama unfolding brilliantly, and the ending haunting and thought-provoking.The screenplay was brilliantly executed, presented from a first-person perspective that allowed me to deeply invest in Oppenheimer's character and yearn to learn more about him. Nolan's choice in this aspect was reminiscent of his earlier film ""Memento.""The cast was outstanding, with Robert Downey Jr. Delivering a surprising and impressive performance, especially after his role in ""Zodiac."" Cillian Murphy was a force to be reckoned with, as always, and even Gary Oldman as Truman and the special mentions to Jeana did an excellent job.The music, composed by Ludwig, was simply mind-blowing. I was already awestruck by his work in ""Tenet,"" and now he brings an amazing score to ""Oppenheimer"" that haunts and adds an eerie atmosphere to the film.This movie is screenplay-heavy and demands attention to detail. Experiencing it in IMAX is highly recommended, particularly for the trinity test scene, which is mind-blowing. But it's not a film for those seeking heavy CGI and dramatic theater experiences. So, if that's what you're expecting, it's best to avoid it.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" will leave you deep in thought and silence for quite a while after watching it. It's an emotional rollercoaster that leaves a lasting impact.4 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Um, no Japanese actors in it. Wonder why? Bohring.joachimokeefe21 July 2023This is a 3-hour long, drama-documentary about the scientist behind the US atomic bomb - emphasis on the drama. Except there is no drama, it's a courtroom flashback to a long succession of meetings, attended by actors on the up doing impressions of famous people from the past. Who were, on the whole, very unpleasant. Chain-smoking, philandering, swotty show-offs, some of them.Because there is no drama, Nolan has to introduce sex scenes; without them, 'Oppenheimer' would be like The West Wing set in 1943. Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy certainly deliver the thespian goods (no chain-smoking for Oppie or daily booze for Grovesy, mind), but there are only two sources of tension:1, Will the Nazis develop The Bomb first?2, Was Oppenheimer a Comyanist?Since everybody knows the answer to both those questions - well, No.1, even if you weren't paying attention - this film is more about 'how well is history dramatised?' Yes, the History Channel will be gnawing its heart out, but even they don't squeeze out 3 hour-shows.This. Movie. Has. No. Story. There are far better movies, and far better books. Nolan tries to cram everything, including quantum theory, in and the result is a long and tedious firework display. By the end, you're wishing you'd never been Born.75 out of 250 found this helpful.

"Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hypeJPARM-IMDb25 July 2023I have to admit: Oppenheimer didn't live up to the hype for me. This is not a bad film per se and while it depicts a frightening turning point in history, its style didn't suit me.Overall I think it's too densely packed and there isn't a payoff for the 3-hour runtime. I didn't feel emotionally connected to any of the characters because they are underdeveloped. There are different timelines, subjects and characters that get introduced and are gone before we get to known or care for them. Plus, the movie is overly dialogue-heavy and politically oriented for its own good. I enjoy engaging conversations but it's filled with technical dialogue, hearings and bureaucracy, which doesn't work for me. I might as well read a book or a Wikipedia page.I will, however, praise the acting of the entire cast and the immersive score and sound design. I wish I could say the same about the visual effects but I found what we were presented underwhelming.10 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Exceptional film about the father of the atomic bomb!roxy349928 July 2023This movie was absolutely brilliant. The performance from Cillian Murphy was so genuine as J. Robert Oppenheimer. A perfect performance from him.Robert Downey Jr also had one of the top performances in the film as well. One of the greatest of his career. Give that man an Oscar! Matt Damon, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh and Emily blur also gave incredible performances too. The guy that played Albert Einstein looked exactly like the genius himself I was spooked but in a good way.The sound in this film was a little scary. It physically made me jump, it was sonical.Christopher Nolan's direction on this phenomenal masterpiece was Masterclass and is for me the one to win best director throughout awards season.This movie for me is everything not one bad thing to say.

"""Property is Theft""... Are you kidding me?schlomo-jones21 July 2023I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.Firstly, Is it worth seeing? Yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. It's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. It looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. Obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe CGI didn't look good. Either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in IMAX, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.Much of the film focuses on the personality of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is fantastic. However, the plot focuses heavily on the McCarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the Atomic Energy Commission. Of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of Oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), Oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, Oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally Oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.The follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named Lewis Strauss, potrayed by Robert Downey, jr. This is where the plot gets lost. Without knowing all the details of Strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. This part of the story dragged on forever.Now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. It's true that Oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. However, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point Oppenheimer to different people.I also found it odd that Nolan decided to include Einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than Oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.I also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where Oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by Florence Pugh. They start talking about Marx's Capital, how she's read all three volumes. He says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. MASSIVE FACEPALM moment.Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or Marx, would know that ""Property is Theft"" is a famous slogan from Pierre Joseph-Proudhon, an anarchist who Karl Marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. Ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and Marxists have not seen eye to eye. No Marxist, let alone a CPUSA member in the 1930's, would be misquoting Marx with Proudhon. This was either a glaring oversight, OR deliberate trolling on the part of Nolan. I'm not sure.Either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. Nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his Dark Knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet Tory, so I don't trust him to portray Oppeheimer's saga accurately. I found a lot of similar issues with Aaron Sorkin's dreadful Lucille Ball biopoc. The idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as naïve youthful indiscretions. All the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.There are a lot of other issues that I could talk about how general Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of Oppenheimer. By some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected Groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and Nazis were in the US at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). Of course Groves pushed through Oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.Wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. Don't take these biopics at face value as real history.83 out of 125 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Horrible dialogue sound issuesGoSpursGo728 July 2023After making a semi pilgrimage to watch this film in one of the handful of IMAX theaters in California, my main takeaway is frustration. Way too much of the dialogue is drowned out by background noise. Struggling to make sense of what characters are saying is not my idea of a good time. The director appears to have fallen in love with this technique. While he and ""critics"" verbally put an artistic spin on it, I truly believe there's nothing more to it than a deep seated power complex. It really knocked the enjoyment down several pegs for me.

SpectacularJessicamtejeda26 July 2023This is one of those movies that makes you want to learn more. Not only was the story told with such vivid images without showing any. The acting is emotionally complex and layered. The sound track was amazing. The use of silence was amazing. Loved everything about this movie and plan to watch again and again.It's definitely a movie that needs multiple viewings since there are so many pieces to the story. It's not as simple as one man's actions. The use of color and lack of in areas to define the time was incredibly helpful to follow a complex story. Rarely do I feel movies leave the viewer's having conversations about morality and a view on how devastating technology can be. This is one. Just an amazing movie.4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"PEAK CINEMAnahiyanrock21 July 2023I dont what to write about this Masterful craft which is so finely done. Every Pixel on the screen served its purpose. Its a biography of one of the most influential physicist of all time. Oppenheimer's character played by Cillian Murphy was just PERFECT. The intensity, complexity and tragedy of the brilliant minds of that time is portrayed like never before.. Also the cast overall is brilliant and unique. World war 2 is the most impactful event of the history of mankind. Personally its very intriguing to me and I love to study the history of our ancestors. The movie portrays the agony and guilt that came afterwards in the life of Oppenheimer. How he was comflicted within himself. How his agony eats him alive and how he was later misunderstood because of his character. I urge people to witness history like never before.4 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A Subtle Masterpiecejaysonpajaronvistal21 July 2023In Christopher Nolan's 2023 film 'Oppenheimer', audiences are treated to a masterful cinematic experience that delves into the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the 'father of the atomic bomb.' The film is a meticulously crafted biographical drama that explores the complexities of Oppenheimer's character and the moral dilemmas faced during the creation of the world's most destructive weapon.Uncharacteristic of Nolan's filmography, 'Oppenheimer' delivers its narrative through quiet nuances that demand the audience's attention and engagement. For instance, a poignant scene where Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) wordlessly observes the destructive potential of his creation, the atomic bomb, beautifully captures this subtlety. The scene speaks volumes about Oppenheimer's internal turmoil, showcasing Nolan's skill in visual storytelling.The performances in 'Oppenheimer' are nothing short of stellar. Oscar-worthy turns from Robert Downey Jr. And Emily Blunt powerfully anchor the film, with Downey Jr.'s nuanced portrayal of his character adding a remarkable depth to the narrative. Emily Blunt's performance is equally compelling, delivering a magnetic charisma that captivates the audience. Despite her limited screen time, Florence Pugh makes a significant impact, further demonstrating her impressive range as an actress.In his first leading role in a Nolan film, Cillian Murphy delivers an extraordinary performance that is both deeply nuanced and profoundly moving. His portrayal of Oppenheimer is so compelling, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Murphy's performance is a masterclass in character depth that deserves an Oscar nomination.Unlike many of Nolan's previous films, 'Oppenheimer' is less about pyrotechnics and more about the character study at its heart. This dialogue-driven narrative creates a palpable tension that simmers throughout the film, giving it explosive energy even in the absence of literal explosions. This thoughtful approach elevates the film to a higher plane of storytelling, making Oppenheimer a richly rewarding cinematic experience.The screenplay, crafted with meticulous attention to detail, is another impressive aspect of 'Oppenheimer'. It blends historical facts with a deeply personal narrative, creating an engaging and thought-provoking story. The dialogue is packed with meaning, driving the narrative forward and revealing layers of character depth.This film's success highlights the critical role of writers in the film industry, particularly in light of the recent SAG-AFTRA strike. The strike underscores the need for fair compensation and treatment of writers whose creativity and labor are integral to the production of quality films like 'Oppenheimer'. Without their invaluable contribution, cinema would lack the richness, diversity, and depth that audiences around the world cherish.The film's one shortcoming, however, lies in the sound score. While the score itself is magnificent, its volume often overshadows the dialogue, making it challenging to discern what the characters are saying at times. This sometimes gives the impression that the characters are mumbling, detracting slightly from the overall experience.Despite this minor issue, 'Oppenheimer' stands as a testament to Nolan's vision and the cast's stellar performances. It is a thought-provoking, character-driven film that cements Nolan's status as one of today's most visionary directors.1 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Important, well shot and brilliantly acted.bcummi22 July 2023The only downfalls of Oppenheimer come in some of the editing (please editors, let some of these moments breathe) and the near constant score. Some more times of quietness would be good. Otherwise, a terrific watch and a movie future generations should see.The entire cast provide meaningful, emotional and genuine performances. Cillian Murphy is incredible in the lead, giving us a true anchor for our journey into the world of atomics and quantum physics. The cinematography is incredible, depicting the scope and grandeur Christopher Nolan is known for. The sound design too was incredible, all sounding authentic and perfectly matched to what was on screen.2 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Absolutely a masterpieceaaronfarve26 July 2023Cillian Murphy has now had his greatest performance of his career if he does not win best actor at the Oscar's something is very wrong in my opinion. And this movie is going to be hard to beet for me as the movie of the year. The story was very good I did not even feel that 3 hour run time at all. No spoilers but the parallel from world War 3 politics to today's political climate is astounding the sound mix of the movie was great the direction of the movie was Oscar worthy Robert Downey Jr. Was fantastic his best performance of his career as well the score of the movie was great this is very intense in places over all I loved it.2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"A Fiery Fusion of History and Drama!devamsonigra-1440727 July 2023This movie is quite different from Nolan's usual style. As the title suggests, it primarily focuses on Oppenheimer's life rather than the anticipated nuclear blasts. The highly hyped nuclear blast scene didn't meet the grand expectations, though it did create some tension for a short while.Instead of being a typical blockbuster, the film leans more towards a documentary and courtroom drama, exploring historical events and personal stories. Viewers should manage their expectations accordingly. With a three-hour runtime, it requires a certain level of commitment from the audience, making it essential to have a good understanding of physics and history to fully appreciate the film and avoid potential boredom.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I predict accolades all around and if this doesn't sweep awards season I would be SHOCKED.Fun fact, no CGI. Everything is practical affects. The film is long (3 hours) so choose your breaks in the first hour.Wonderfully surprised by the political story as well. I had no idea.

"""Can you hear the music?""Aziz2429 July 2023Synopsis: Oppenheimer handles a huge project of the creation of the atomic bomb that leads to all kinds of consequences on his personal life and many others surrounding him. This leads him to be the father of the atomic bomb and ""the destroyer of worlds"" as he becomes one of the most important figures in history.Directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer himself in a lead role for the first time in a Nolan film, after being in most of his films. Cillian Murphy looks nothing like the real Robert Oppenheimer physically. Yet, Murphy is able to portray the famous figure in a role that would lead him to win an academy award easily. From facial expressions to Cillian Murphy's wide eyes that are capable of speaking without him having to say a word and how they also can express guilt, regret, sadness, confusion, and all sorts of feelings that Oppenheimer went through while completing the complex project of the atomic bomb. As well as, the support of the make up and hair design department, audience members are able to capture Oppenheimer in three different stages of his life, young version, middle aged version, and an older version of the character. After his role in The TV Show Peaky Blinders (2013 - 2022) as Thomas Shelby, his popularity grew and everyone sees him as Shelby. However, after watching this film, audience members will easily forget that and a new image will be created in everyone's head as him being Robert J Oppenheimer.Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss gives such a heavy and top tier acting role that his presence can be heavily felt on screen and in the events and the different stages that his character goes through. It is by far the second best acting role in the film after Cillian Murphy's, it is for Sure Oscar worthy for Best Supporting actor. Same thing will Cillian's image among fans, RDJ has the image of Tony Stark/ironMan in everyone's head. Everyone has gotten used to seeing him as that superhero who flies and shoots lasers from his hands. But, that image can e easily forgotten after watching this film. I am not denying every great thing he did for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man as I am a huge fan of it. But, this film reminds everyone of who RDJ really is as the actor who is able to portray and put on some great acting skills and Oscar worthy performance like he used to before as Harry Lockhart in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), Charles Chaplin in Chaplin (1992), or Paul Avery in Zodiac (2007).On the other hand, Matt Damon as Leslie Groves is the only role that added nothing to the table compared to everyone else's appearance. Even though he has a huge screen time and he plays an important role in the story, some other actors have less screen time than him and they did a better job. Like Rami Malek and Edward Teller.Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Rami Malek as David Hill, and Alden Ehrenreich as Senate Aide throughout the whole film, do not have a scene that would put the spotlight on them and make them noticeable until we reach towards the end in which all of them will have their time, their moment, and their scene to shine which what made those scenes very special specifically because of their acting skills.In addition, there are so many other actors that appeared in the film (some are a surprise) in which they all have some great scenes and great acting skills that will lead them to shine in their scene and I will refuse to mention them to avoid any spoilers and it would rather be better if you walk into this movie not knowing that they will make an appearance.The film deals with sound effects in the most amazing way especially in moments of silence whenever the film focuses on Oppenheimer's point of view and what goes through his head in terms of fear, regret and confusion like heavy breathing, screams or countdowns.On the other hand, the film's sound mixing is horrible to the point that it may holdback a viewer's experience and understanding of the events of the film due to the struggle of hearing the dialogue. It's either their voice can hardly be heard, or the music at most times is louder than the speech. This is not a first time for a Nolan film as films like Tenet (2020) and The Dark Knight (2012) have a very similar issue in terms of hearing the speech.Not to mention that the Music score - that was louder than the speech at most times - is greatly composed by Ludwig Göransson who returns again with Nolan as he composed Tenet (2020) in which the similarities can be heard between both Tenet (2020) and Oppenheimer (2023). There is a specific tone and vibe that Ludwig Göransson used in both films to deliver the film in the way it should be. However, many have surprisingly compared Ludwig Göransson's work in Oppenheimer (2023) to Hans Zimmer's work in previous Nolan films like in Interstellar (2014) by specifically comparing Ludwig Göransson's music piece ""Can You Hear the Music"" in Oppenheimer to Hans' ""S. T. A. Y"" in Interstellar (2014). In my opinion, this is a totally unfair compression as Ludwig Göransson's work is nothing compared to Hans' work. That does not mean that Ludwig Göransson work is not that good but I just think that comparing what Hans Zimmer did lowers Hans' work quality as well as Ludwig Göransson's work.When promoting the film, it is suggested that seeing it in IMAX 70MM is A MUST which hyped everything as expectations has risen that audience members will probably experience something similar to Interstellar when it comes to the visuals and the cinematography. Yet, most of the film is literally being shot indoors with no room for visually stunning shots to even be introduced and present because the film depends on dialogues in the first place.But, does that mean that seeing in IMAX 70MM was NOT worth it? NO Does that mean that I DON'T recommend everyone to go see it in IMAX 70MM (the format it is suppose to be seen in)? NO Because, how often do film directors release films that are shot using IMAX cameras and are offered in IMAX 70MM (film IMAX and not digital IMAX)? It's probably once every 2-3 years. Therefore, I do highly recommend anyone to see it in IMAX 70MM FILM for the full experience and I promise it won't disappoint and the next time a film will be offered in IMAX 70MM will provably be in 2 or 3 years. But, I really was hoping and expecting an Interstellar or Avatar (2009), type of cinematography.The story of Robert J Oppenheimer isn't as complicated as how it is being introduced in this film. But, isn't the way that Nolan introduced and made this whole biography film different, unique and more complicated than other biography films, is what truly makes Nolan a unique film director?This is the first time that Nolan does a biography/based on a true story type of film and Im more than glad that HE did it, because I'm 100% positive that any other filmmaker would've turned it into an ordinary, usual and typical biography film without including any complications or mind blowing twists like Christopher Nolan.My rating is 9.5 (MIGHT CHANGE ON 2ND VIEWING) Format watched in: FILM IMAX 70MM Watched on: July 26th, 2023.1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"This is quite possibly the best movie of the last decade. Nolan and Cilian might just finally bag their oscarsharisgala-2224321 July 2023After his last outing Tenet, which wasn't as well received, Nolan decided to venture a biography. Oppenheimer is very different from all the movies Nolan has attempted before, deviating from his SciFi orgasm and moving towards reality and grounded cinema. It could be a recency bias from my end, but I think Oppenheimer is quite possibly Nolan's best movie till date. It's a culmination of all the things Nolan attempted in his prior movies: the cinematography, the sound, the bgm, the screenplay; everything just works in a perfect culmination. The BGM of this movie makes the scenes erupt with tension and add a different perspective altogether. The tension created esp in the scene where the bomb is tested is just an iconic scene altogether. It's so brilliantly shot and executed that words cannot do justice to it. Another iconic scene is where Cilian gives his celebratory speech, which shows what an intelligent filmmaker Nolan is. The actors are amazing with their roles. Cilian and Robert Downey just steal the show overall. Although it's 3 hours long, but you're so engaged in this movie, thanks to the brilliant screenplay with Nolan who juggles with so much content, yet executes it brilliantly, that this movie never feels like a bore. One of the finest movies to come out of Hollywood and it deserves a watch. A Must Watch.2 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Great story poorly told.tony-stoneman24 July 2023This film told the incredible story of how some of the worlds most brilliant minds achieved one of histories most momentous tasks. It contained some excellent acting performances and the dialogue was well written. However, there were parts of the story that were overly long and laboured with some of the special effect interventions either unnecessary or too long & dramatic. The single most dissipate annoying feature of the film (a common issue today in film and TV) was the sound. There were barely 10 seconds of silence in the whole 3 hours. The dial was overlayed with 'music' or sounds for almost the whole film, even when just two characters were conversing. There were sections of dialogue in the film which I will never know as they were impossible to discern being drowned out by the accompanying sound. Disappointing.11 out of 17 found this helpful.

The movie is so well made and everything is very enjoyable, the emotions of the actors and everything was on point. Murphy did a wonderful job but lets not forget about Downey jr. And Jason Clarke who gave such intense emotions which made me very curious about what will happend next. The fx were incredible and everything seemed so realistic you could'nt tell if it was real or computer made.

"One of the best movie experiences of my lifejuampabrizuela23 July 2023In simple words, Christopher Nolan is THE GOAT... Oppenheimer reaffirms it again. With each film in his filmography, he has established himself as one of the best directors in the industry. Each new work surpasses its predecessor. This film is the synthesis of what Nolan is himself, cinema.3 hours of film that go by in an instant. From the first minute the plot grabs you and doesn't let go until the black screen appears that signs the creator of the wonder that our eyes have just witnessed.Let's talk about another kind of magic in the movie. An acting chair for the entire cast. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr straight to the Oscar. Allow me the comparison, but it is as inevitable as the creation of Oppenheimer himself. The rest of the cast, exactly the same. Each one appears at their opportune moment and gives their best to complete the work.What else can we talk about? The musicalization in absolute harmony with each scene, the narrative as impeccable and captivating as only Nolan knows how to do it and each frame teleports you to the historical moment that it shows you.Oppenheimer is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and it has given me a cinematic experience that I will never forget. For someone like me who loves movies so much, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is the most comforting caress to the soul.4 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Destroyer of Worldsaciessi23 July 2023Here is what you need to know. Oppenheimer is one of the best films of the decade. This is a film you must see, regardless of whether or not you watch a lot of movies. See it on the biggest IMAX screen you can. It is as much an engrossing document of vital history as it is an unparalleled sensory experience. This film is of course about the invention of nuclear weaponry, and of course, you'll get up close and personal to a real detonation. But that's nowhere near the thrill behind Oppenheimer. In fact, there isn't supposed to be one. Oppenheimer is a blistering indictment of the bomb's creation and a passionate anti-war plea. What's more, is that this is a masterful character study about the man behind the bomb, and the agonizing regret he felt about creating it in the first place.J. Robert Oppenheimer was a curious physicist who in one lifetime received the ultimate praise and the ultimate ire from the nation he belonged to. Summoned by the U. S. military, he served as the brains behind the Manhattan Project and the creation of the first, second and only atomic bombs ever used in battle. For that moment, Oppenheimer brought about the brutal end of a world war, but that was exactly the problem. A brutal end to a brutal war, and forever, the world had changed. Oppenheimer gave birth to the first weapon of mass destruction, and every nation on earth wanted one of their own. The arms race was on. The end of the world, suddenly, a possibility. If that weren't enough already, his greatest scientific ally betrays him in a stunning act of jealousy and personal enrichment, leading to a demoralizing persecution at the hands of the U. S. Government at the height of the red scare.Oppenheimer becomes the physical manifestation of guilt and yes, death. Wracked with unending pain, we see his body begin to consume itself. His eyes stare straight into the abyss. His frame, gaunt and emaciated. Always seemingly on the verge of tears. Cillian Murphy delivers an unforgettable performance that I struggle to think won't land him an Oscar next year. For three hours, Murphy is spellbinding, and that is incredible given the fact that for the most part, he is simply talking with other people. Oppenheimer, by that affect, is not a laborious chore to sit through, but instead, a living and breathing historical account. Robert Downey Jr., as the backstabbing Lewis Strauss is instantly the clear front runner for Best Supporting Actor in a performance that mirrors F. Murray Abraham in Amadeus.Oppenheimer is many great movies in one, and for Christopher Nolan, that comes with so much ease. In every aspect, he approaches the material with the gravity it deserves and not once does it meander and and lose focus of the core information behind the story. That unto itself is a tremendous undertaking, and without a doubt, Nolan passes that test.4 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Multi Oscar Pictureinfo-5806121 July 2023Amazing movie, the best I have seen this year. Nolan keeps high class. I think Oppenheimer will win at least 6 Oscars in 2024. Top class actors, even in episodes - like Gary Oldman, Matt Modine, Casey Affleck, etc. Cillian Murphy played his best role and deserves Oscar. Like Robert Dawney Jr. - his play was outstanding. Christopher Nolan deserves his oscar too. Every film detail is perfect. Here is my opinion regarding Oscars: Best actor - Cillian Murphy, Supporting actor - Robert Dawney Jr., Best directing - Christopher Nolan, Best Picture - Oppenheimer, Best original screenplay - Oppenheimer, Best film editing - Oppenheimer.4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Nolan's best film without a doubt!neilbowers22 July 2023It has taken me 24 hrs to calm down after watching the amazing film Oppenheimer. To put it bluntly it is quite simply mesmorising from start to finish and the hours just fly by.At the end of the film I have never seen an audience with shock on their faces at what they've just witnessed and people just sat in their seats for 5 minutes before saying anything.It took me and my son 20 minutes to speak to each other as we were taking in the film and everything that we'd just witnessed on the screen and we're still talking about it now it was that good.Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his life as Oppenheimer who was chosen to lead the Manhatten Project and then haunted by what he'd just achieved once the bomb had gone off.Robert Downey Jr has also given the performance of his career and if he doesn't scoop the Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars nextt year then it'll be a tragedy. The last 45 minutes of the film is the best i've ever seen him act.The supporting cast are just as good and really makes the film. Emily Blunt was great as his wife. Florence Pugh as his lover. Rami Malek as phyisacist Hill, Jason Clarke who's character interrogated Oppenheimer all worthy of a mention.The tension that built up to when the bomb first exploded is something i've never experienced before in a film. You really thought that it had failed and were williing it to succeed.The seeing Murphy playing the haunted Oppenheimer in the second half was just something else.Quite simply amazing and this is a film i'd advise everyone to watch in IMAX if you can but it will still blow you away.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"Awesome!!!srastogi5028 July 2023The best among all of Christopher Nolan movies so far. An Historical events told in a most gripping ways, which only he can do. Such an overwhelming cast, worth the story and characters. Cillian Murphy acting as Dr Robert Oppenheimer is beyond words. He is surely getting nominated for Oscars along with Christopher Nolan and others for most of the major categories. Cinematography and sound is another +++.Three phases of story told simultaneously, interwoven so well it will keep you fully engaged. Equally mesmerizing is the interrogation and debates after the Japan bombing. Watch it on iMax screen for maximum fun. Loved it thoroughly.1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

I think I first heard about it in 2021, or 2022, either way I couldn't wait to watch this movie. And I am sooo impressed with how it turned out. Though long, it kept me captivated all throughout. I didn't want to miss a minute. Excellent performances by Blunt and Downey but of course Cillian stole the show for me. What an incredible performance as Oppenheimer. I'm so glad that Cillian is finally receiving the recognition he SO DESERVES. If he had social media I'd be spamming him telling him how amazing he is lol.I truly pray he gets an Oscar for his role.

"Nolan's first biopic is a masterpiece.the-tylerw22 July 2023This movie is such a departure from a standard Nolan film in that it is a true story. It is a story about how a group of people got together to change the world through science and maybe not for the better. The story that is told is very clear, there is a pre-Nuclear war world and a post-Nuclear war world. The US spent almost 3 billion in 1945 money on a single project that would shape the nature of warfare and it was done by some pretty awful people, most of all J Robert Oppenheimer.The movie itself is almost perfect. Incredible pacing and storytelling. Incredible acting from everyone. There are so many ""Oh that's so and so"" moments throughout the movie and it felt like every single performance was genuine. From the first frame, the visuals and the score really drive home this sense of impending doom and anxiety. That pace never lets up and by the time you hit the final act it doesn't at all feel like it's been 3 hours. Visually I just can't say enough about this movie. Hoyte Van Hoytema is going to walk away with his first Academy Award and if he doesn't it will be straight up robbery. After saying all of this I'm not sure this is a film that you are meant to enjoy. It's really heavy in subject matter and it's implications.

"Unworthy of such an important event in historyFrancois-528 July 2023I believe that we must distinguish the film and the story. The events that inspired this movie are tremendously important and fascinating; but the film itself is a fiasco. First, it is far too long. The first half is a classic portrait of a scientist working on a project. It has nothing outstanding from a cinematic point of view. I had to wait an hour and a half before seeing anything inspired and inspiring. Then, there's the sound: the constant presence of music or sound effects drowns the dialogues and is really, really irritating, while serving a presumably dramatic purpose. The camera work is shallow and uninspired, at best: definitely not what one would expect in a film presented as a great piece of cinema. Fortunately, the actors do a first-class job throughout all this mediocrity.Overall, Oppenheimer fell far below my expectations. This story deserved a much more subtle approach.9 out of 15 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"It was... okayymrhqtrz25 July 2023Now I know that what I might say might be a tad bit controversial... but I genuinely for the life of me do not understand how people are giving this film such high reviews and Barbie such low reviews. I watched these two films together (started with Barbie and then Oppenheimer) and wholeheartedly speaking Barbie comes on top (there was depth to the characters, the performances were amazing, the storyline brilliant, the emotions and humor tugged at your heartstrings). The same cannot be said for Oppenheimer. The film was good, not amazing but good. The cinematography was fantastic, performances brilliant. However, at 3 hours long the film did not keep my attention, if anything I fell asleep only to wake up towards the middle of the movie which is why I'm giving my score of 7. The storyline dragged, the characters were written well but were tiring to watch at times. I would say wait for the film to come out on Apple TV and rent it from there.2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"Extraordinaryradders_00720 July 2023Title: A Critical Review: Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer""In ""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan plunges into the labyrinth of the Manhattan Project, depicting the life and internal conflict of Robert Oppenheimer, the man at the epicenter of it all. Nolan, known for his sophisticated narratives, delivers yet another stirring and profound masterpiece.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is at the heart of the film. Murphy captures the multifaceted persona of Oppenheimer with profound authenticity, manifesting the physicist's intellectual brilliance and the moral torment that ensued from his involvement in the creation of the atomic bomb. His depiction of Oppenheimer is a masterstroke in acting, brilliantly portraying a man on the razor's edge of scientific discovery and human destruction.Emily Blunt as Katherine, Oppenheimer's wife, offers a moving performance. Her depiction of a woman wrestling with the moral implications of her husband's work is deeply touching. Blunt's nuanced portrayal provides an affecting counterpoint to Murphy's tormented Oppenheimer, forming an emotionally resonant narrative core.Robert Downey Jr., in his most profound role since ""Chaplin,"" plays Lewis Strauss, the stern figurehead of the Atomic Energy Commission. Abandoning his typically charismatic persona, Downey Jr. Brings an intensity and seriousness that is riveting. His performance offers a stark look at the determination of the U. S. administration during the atomic age. His role as Strauss adds a layer of authority and command to the narrative, effectively embodying the bureaucratic pressure that fueled the Manhattan Project.Nolan's directorial prowess shines throughout, masterfully weaving together the personal turmoil of Oppenheimer with the wider socio-political climate of the era. The pacing is expertly managed, building tension incrementally before culminating in a classic Nolan climax.""Oppenheimer"" excels in historical representation. The production design, costumes, and cinematography blend together to create an immersive 1940s world. Shot for IMAX, the movie provides a truly authentic and captivating experience.However, the film's complex narrative structure could be a point of critique. At times, the story can feel a little convoluted, and certain plotlines may get obscured. Despite this minor shortcoming, the film's central themes and emotional impact remain strong and potent.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a deeply moving examination of one of history's most controversial figures. The compelling performances by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and an unexpectedly serious Robert Downey Jr. Offer a rich and diverse portrayal of characters. Though the narrative complexity might pose challenges for some viewers, Nolan's deft directorial hand ensures a captivating and reflective cinematic experience. ""Oppenheimer"" serves as a stark reminder of the weighty moral responsibilities accompanying scientific advancement, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.7 out of 19 found this helpful.

"Honest review without spoilersmmichal-oravec29 July 2023A lot of people call this immediately future classic, masterpiece, lucky to witness it and so much more.For me - Oppenheimer movie is still good, very good, probably one of the best I could watch in past year. But it still missed a little (and maybe in some things even more than a little) to be called such names.Biggest problem was probably storyline and pace. I have to admit, if I wasn't such science and physics geek I would rate this movie even lower. For me, there wasn't any moment that would grab me - only plot twist there was could be seen from row on popcorn before movie even start. Music was, eh, there was a music? Maybe I'm too spoiled from previous scores, but this wasn't something I would wrote home about. And after first few opening scenes that were visualy amazing, there wasn't any more visualy moments that I would floor me - again I was used to see in Nolan movies. Also lot of characters were little bit shallow, lot of the motives and actions were let on viewer to imagine them and fill the gaps.On the positive note, the inner struggle of main protagononist was done extremely well and sometime you could almost grasp what it could be to live in this moment and as this person - with all it's positive and negative effects.0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"Oppenheimer, Nolan's masterpiece!EduardoRoglin29 July 2023This is cinema! For me, this is Nolan's most impactful masterpiece. It is without a doubt the best adaptation of a book I have ever seen. The story is portrayed in an incredible, tense and dynamic way. I like the fact that it is dynamic because it manages to hold the viewer well even in moments that would be calmer or even a little boring in other stories, but here everything is done very well for you to hold. One thing that helps to keep you hooked is the incredible interpretation of the actors, giving life and high realism to their characters and I especially highlight Cillian Murphy who is the soul of Oppenheimer. The film manages to convey the feeling of the scene very well, especially seconds before the explosion, making us feel in the protagonist's shoes and what helps is the fact that Nolan has not used any CGI the whole film, so it makes us anxious for the result as well as Oppenheimer and his co-workers.0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"A brilliant masterpiece that cuts to the core of human fearshow24studio19 July 2023Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'flowers of the killer moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture.

"Cinematic Masterpiecedeenkhalil21 July 2023Oppenheimer had quite possibly the best cinematography of any movie I have ever seen. The visuals were outstanding. I was mesmerized as I watched every scene. This movie was filmed entirely in IMAX and the film stretched multiple miles long. The black and white scenes were also filmed in 70mm Black & White, which has never been used before. This is just the cherry on top of the cinematography.The score in this movie was wonderful as well. The background music kept the movie intense, and even scary in some scenes. The impact that the sound effects made in the theater was incredible, it made the movie that much better. Absolutely wonderful!I don't think I need to get into the acting-but I will. The cast of this movie is as stacked as much as any movie i've ever seen. Cillian Murphy provides a performance of the century, which leads this movie in its success. RDJ also delivers an immaculate performance as the supporting actor, and it is possibly his best performance ever. These two will both be nominated for oscar's this upcoming year. The rest of the cast each had their own role to play and have ZERO complaints with any of them, they all did a wonderful job, 10 Acting in this movie.Christopher Nolan did an incredible job depicting the real story and turning into a movie. The movie stays relatively accurate with the actually history of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nolan chose a piece of history that is not only important to him, but is possibly the most important piece of history ever.This movie will impact cinema in a big way. It has multiple lines that will remembered for a long time. Oppenheimer could single-handedly bring back the popularity of biopic films. This movie was highly anticipated and rightfully so. This is Nolan's best work in my opinion, and that is saying a lot considering he is one of the best directors of our time. I, personally, am thankful to be alive to witness Nolan's work, and especially to witness this cinematic masterpiece of a film.Thank You, Christopher Nolan.4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"Easily Nolan's top 3 and best of the yeardumnii21 July 202321st July. First day first showAfter finishing TENET, Nolan had said that he's working on the genre of horror. If only people knew what horror he was talking about. The story was shown in a great detailed way, it spans over a few decades of events. Makes sense why it's 3 hours long. After seeing the fast paced nature of TENET. Oppenheimer felt calming, like a thunderstorm before dawn, leaving the sweet smell of wet Earth.But boy was it dark. And Cillian Killed it. Nolan is like the kid with a camera, putting the giant IMAX lens on the very face of the actors. It's a very intimate storytelling. It's not grand, it felt very personal. A story exploring the core of one of the biggest events in the history of the world.Don't listen to the morons who are calling it as boring.

"Oppenheimer: A Cinematic Marvel with Stellar Performances!amrateek20 July 2023Oppenheimer is an absolute triumph in every sense! This biographical masterpiece artfully depicts the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the exceptional performances by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. As Strauss deserve standing ovations. Murphy's ability to capture Oppenheimer's complex persona, from scientific brilliance to inner struggles, was simply astounding. Equally praiseworthy was Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Strauss, effortlessly bringing depth and charisma to the character.The cinematography in Oppenheimer is awe-inspiring. In particular, the scene showcasing the Trinity bomb's mushroom cloud was a visual marvel. Nolan's skillful use of visuals transported the audience into that historic moment, evoking a mix of emotions ranging from awe to reflection. The movie's attention to historical accuracy and meticulous research added to its authenticity and made it a compelling journey through one of the most pivotal periods in history.From start to finish, Oppenheimer keeps you hooked with its engaging storytelling, impeccable pacing, and thought-provoking dialogue. It delves into the ethical dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and his team during the creation of the atomic bomb, leaving audiences pondering the consequences of scientific advancements and the weight of responsibility that accompanies such discoveries.The supporting cast delivered commendable performances, enriching the overall narrative.

"Goes To OSCAR....riyyadh23 July 2023A post appreciation for the film, this time Oppenheimer's film by Christopher Nolan, and this is the second time in this near me experience of a ""true film""Why is that? Film is the product of several aspects/divisions from writers, composers and many more, and this film or Christopher Nolan manages to stitch all of that into a whole and ""good"" filmmaybe this seems to make this film good but in my opinion and for me because it started not to have more expectations in this film it turned out to be more than imagined, and Nolan did it.How many media or actor Robert Downey in this film talk that this is a MAGNUM OPUS and yep idk what to say, this is the best film I watched in my entire life (still 12 angry man number one but).And lastly, maybe there is momentum or the writing/method of ""playing"" this will potentially be used or used by future directors.P.

"Oppenheimer stands out as one of the decade's most captivating films and serves as a reminder that cinema is an endeavor that requires hard work and perseverance.Fineapplespov24 July 2023This film is heavily dominated by dialogues. If you are a fan of action-packed films, you might find it boring. Although the film revolves around the topic of an atomic bomb, don't expect to see numerous explosions throughout the movie. Instead, it focuses not on the scientific formation of an atomic bomb, although there are some theories explained briefly, but on detailing the journey of Oppenheimer with his ideas, knowledge, strategies, and all the complexities he faced in creating the atomic bomb, which was ultimately used on Japan.This film is expensive and high-class, destined for the Oscars without a doubt. It features a star-studded cast, even the minor roles (despite having little screentime) are portrayed by familiar faces. It's incredible, really.To this day, I just can't stop thinking about the Trinity scene. That's the pinnacle of the film, the moment when my breath was held, and my eyes were glued to the screen. It's remarkable how Nolan manages to make this scene so intense and chilling. Presented with impeccable visuals, music, and acting that needs no doubt, I am truly impressed with this film. The ending was nothing short of a masterpiece that left me with a deep sense of emotion.Surprisingly, this is one of the few Nolan films that I could still understand without being perplexed (apart from its scientific theories). I wish I had a better grasp of the science behind the atomic bomb in this film so that I could give it a rating of 10.Thank you Mr. Nolan and Mr. Cillian, you have once again reminded me of the beauty of the cinematic world.-@fineapplespov.3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Simple 10algenrala25 July 2023I would like to talk about the Oppenheimer movie after I entered the cinema today. Indeed, this movie is really an example of movies that are made for the cinema, not for the home. I would like to stress that this movie is not for all people. Yizenberg and many others, and all the details surrounding the Manhattan Project, whether announced or unknown, surprised me in the film and made me amazed that the film demonized America and its government. Literally, some of its people gather America in this movie. It was a demon. In a scene of Oppenheimer with the president of America after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosion, Oppenheimer tells the president, I feel that my hands are stained with blood. 250,000 people were on his neck, he felt about themselves and their suffering throughout his life, and in the end, his country fought him and made him a traitor, and at the end of his life they honored him after he accepted on himself that he was fighting with all those around him in order to only reduce the guilt that he felt. And I will not forget Oppenheimer Einstein's sentence when he said that there was an opportunity in the Manhattan Project that we are destroying the world with our invention. The truth is that we really destroyed the world, and the feeling of arrogance kept haunting him all his life. This movie is as sweet as it is, but it is dark and depicts the black history of mankind. Not only the future is the one that is full of injustice and corruption, not the past. I was afraid that he would fall into the point of drumming for America and filming it in the role of angel, like most directors, and I wanted him to at least take the field of neutrality, but it surprised me when he portrayed history as black as it is in the past after Germany's withdrawal and Hitler's suicide, and Japan was the salvation of itself, and this is how it will lose, but America also designed a nuclear strike to test it and show its strength.0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"Feels like watching a three-hour-long film trailermaurice_anemaat22 July 2023Capturing a wide array of historic events, characters and themes into one all-encompassing movie proves to be a difficult challenge for any director, and this one is no different.The audiovisual spectacle and certain performances (Robert Downey jr. In example) aside, the majority of scenes felt chaotic, sudden, and lacked length, leaving you with a constant sense of getting outpaced and needing to catch up. It's not necessarily the complexity of the chosen themes, but directional choices in how to portray them, that makes Oppenheimer feel like an overextended film trailer. Watching this is a Sisyphean task if you ask me.4 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Possibly the best film I have ever seenronaldpj21 July 2023Have been here for quite some time (over 50 years) and have watched my share of very good films, but this might very well take the cake.My previous ""top choices"" were Godfather 1 & 2 and Pulp Fiction, but today I saw Oppenheimer in the cinema and it blew me away. I need some time and maybe a re-viewing to get it all into perspective, but it is such a good film on multiple levels. The story is told in a way that you don't get lost, but you also don't see all the pieces until the director wants you to. The acting is phenomenal (not a surprise with a cast like this) and for me (as someone that grew up during the 70's and 80's) the topic of nuclear war fare and the cold war is something that is very, very relatable. And then there is the cinematography and the sound effects that both tremendously enhance the experience.All in all, it would surprise me if this is not already the biggest contender for double digit number of Academy Awards and in my opinion, deservedly so.4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Beautiful, spectacular, tense, emotional, even better than I expected..ajikude29 July 2023Beautiful, spectacular, tense, emotional, even better than I expected.. probably one of the best and most accurate docu-drama-movies ever.Cinematography 10 Sound 10 Script 10 Acting 10 Costume 10 So happy the director didn't ruin it with over CGI and overly fake graphics. The sound effects and sound editing were spectacular. Wish I watched this in IMAX tbh. The acting is excellent. 'Iron man Stark' didn't play his same boring role and actually played a real drama actor for once. There were alot tense moments. Not a dull moment... I can see the controversy over the reading of the Hindu holy book in a scene but none of my hindu friends were angry..they just said the timing of it could have been more appropriate (ie not while in bed).The movie overall was powerful...almost Dark Knight meets Einstein meets Nuclear weapon meets Hiroshima all in one. The movie was not filled with over-woke agenda, the movie just tried to tell it like it was Oppenheimer was definitely not a Communist spy and he was just another victim of the evil McCarthyism. The movie also dumbed down explaining atomic fusion in a way where it was not stupid but rather just simplified...ie it gave the 30 second elevator pitch as to what is an atom bomb. It wasn't insulting to intelligence as alot new Hollywood movies are nowadays. Movies nowadays are so dumbed down by Hollywood but not this one.I might actually watch this movie again, which shows how good and enjoyable it was. It really showed how they tormented Oppenheimer and how extremely intelligent he was. Highly recommended to watch this.1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Oppenheimer sits alongside the best films ever madedaddymojo21 July 2023Oppenheimer, the film from Christopher Nolan has usurped Russians from Dream of the Blue Turtles as the leading edge of cultural awareness for ""father of the atomic bomb"". In that song, Sting flippantly introduced the subject as ""Oppenheimer's deadly toy"". In reality his relationship was much more complex with nuclear weapons than that; but kudos to Sting for introducing a name to millions of folks who otherwise wouldn't have heard it until now. Oppenheimer is a big film in the most Christopher Nolan manner possible. It's a three-hour dramatic tour de force that grabs viewers by their shirt collars and maintains its grip for the vast majority of its run time.Unlike Nolan's other works, Oppenheimer is driven by dramatic sequences, tight dialogue, and acting that's top-notch. There aren't any big action sequences, but viewers who want a breathtaking overview of the Atomic Bomb, its creation and after-effects will be mesmerized. That's all the more amazing because there are about two dozen characters as the film jumps between a 20-year era in history. Those characters are all memorable and their role in Oppenheimer's life and work are always clear, unless they aren't.This is a Christopher Nolan film after all, and some scenes are truncated or have certain lines of dialogue not audible. Those lines or scenes will be seen later in the film, but only when they need to be shown in order to crystallize plot threads. Nolan also uses black and white film to contrast the setting, tone, timing and perspective of the story in a near-perfect manner. There's a reason why some scenes are in color and others aren't. Some characters are shown in a flashback in black and white, then immediately shown in the current story in color, or vice versa. When you see the film, this effect is akin to a chess match that the characters are having.As a film, Oppenheimer is very difficult not to look at. There are dozens of scenes that were filmed close-up, with the minute details of the actor's faces or bodies filling up the screen. And because this is a character-driven film, there are many more opportunities for people to fill the scenes than Nolan's other works.The first act of the film is more of an artistic painter's approach to Oppenheimer as a person, than a traditional movie. There are short, chaotic cuts and close-ups of Cillian Murphy interspersed with micro close-ups of the stages of explosions, reactions and wires that are reacting to electrical charges. This part of Oppenheimer focuses on his early educational life as the background, but it's being presented in hindsight because he is currently being questioned by a Congressional panel.He's a very gifted student who is well-networked, but also mischievous, too direct at times and keenly aware that he's usually the smartest person in the room. As a teacher, he wants to engage in theoretical physics and the concept of energy relating to collapsing stars and the blackness of space. He is also very open-minded, even to those with radical ideas on campus. Because of this, he makes numerous friends in a school communist organization, which unfortunately comes back to haunt him.The classroom next to his is working on a machine that will research, and hopefully split, atoms. As the world's drumbeats to WWII get louder his classes get bigger and his knowledge of physics gets more useful.The world's top physicists have been captured or are working with the Nazis. When they make a key breakthrough in nuclear power Oppenheimer realizes that the world is racing towards weaponizing this new technology. The lab next to his classroom is able to replicate what the Germans did and he's given the chance to form his own team.Oppenheimer teams up with a U. S. General and they create their own research facility in Los Alamos. It's a city where they all live with their families and can conduct testing and research with minimal delay. The film does a great job of making the potentially incomprehensible process of nuclear reactions, bombs, and the science behind them something that non-tech folks can understand. When you see Benny Safdie as Edward Teller talking about a different delivery method for the bomb that could prove more efficient you're able to follow the logic.The success of the bomb's testing starts Oppenheimer's concerns about responsibly using that power. The end of WWII brings even more issues as he runs afoul of certain politicians, which results in his inquiry that started the movie.Oppenheimer is a powerful film that ranks alongside Schindler's List in terms of a war or combat film that will stand the test of time. It's impossible not to compare the two films in terms of quality and deftly telling a story to audiences that aren't familiar with its titular character. The final act of the film focuses on McCarthyism and communist hearing, where his past history, as well as that of his wife and peers, will resonate with folks today.Could you really be held accountable for one meeting that you had with someone a decade and a half ago? Your actions have always been solid, but those who seek you harm are focusing on that meeting or perhaps the beliefs of a second-tier associate. Could you really be held accountable just for RT something on social media? Your actions are solid, but those who don't think like you do will do anything to cause you harm. McCarthyism and the public's zeal to believe or jump on the bandwagon of those who said something on social media that runs counter to what they believe have much in common.Oppenheimer was an independent thinker who wasn't afraid to surround himself with people who question his work or beliefs. While the movie, Oppenheimer was indeed a fantastic piece of cinema, I hope that the irony of those who persecuted him isn't lost on all of audiences and the similarities that they might share.2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Brilliantly acted, filmed, written, edited, and delivered.walshbd-0056921 July 2023I was very slightly cautious about this movie after Dunkirk disappointed, but Nolan once again proves that film an outlier in his quest to deliver masterpiece after masterpiece of cinema.""Oppenheimer"" does not disappoint the viewer at all. Cillian Murphy delivers his finest onscreen performance of his career, one that should undoubtedly draw multiple nominations and awards of the highest order. The same could be said of the entire tremendously put together ensemble cast.Forget the awards however, if they come they come. With or without them this film stands on its own as arguably the greatest film of the 2020's so far, and it very well might maintain that status.I didn't even see the film in IMAX (due to the horrible availability of the format) and the visual and sound were incredible, and I could feel the force it provided throughout the film in my seat as Nolan intended even in a regular cinema.5 out of 11 found this helpful.

"Beyond anything I have ever experienced in a theater.tfkummer21 July 2023It has barely been 30 minutes since Ive seen this Masterpiece in the theater (IMAX of course) and am still trying to process it.The mere storytelling of this 3 hour long movie was masterful. The storybeats take the viewer on a rollercoaster of emotion, something of which I cannot even begin to comprehend or express. The character work of each of the actors was perfection, with smaller cameos from actors I would have not at all expected to see but was very glad to see them when they showed up on screen.I would highly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX. The bomb itself amongst the fantastic soundtrack and sound direction left the theatre shaking.You have to see this movie in the theatre to truly appreciate and fully understand what I mean; it was something special.If I had to pick 1 word to describe this experience, it would be 'Phenomenal'.Highly Recommend.

"It's a Cristopher Nolan filmmrshawdy3329 July 2023Let me start by saying that I enjoyed this movie.All in all, after 3 hours, I felt like my time had been spent well watching a well-crafted, visually and emotionally compelling biography about Robert Oppenheimer.It was good. If you like film, go see it in a theater (in IMAX if possible)However, it is a Christopher Nolan film.Meaning.... A lot of characters to keep track of, longer run time, lots and lots of dialogue, etc.This is not the kind of movie you would turn on in the background while dozing off scrolling on instagram.This movie, you have to stay attentive to the details, dialogue, and the story.BUT, because of this hyper-focused nature of the movie, you truly start to feel the story and emotions behind Oppenheimer, and begin to understand the complex nature of Nolan's story telling. I'd say it's worth the extra focus.Personally, I'd set this as slightly better than Tenet, but not to the lengths of Inception.Go see it :)3 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A unique and unforgettable cinematic experience.ashleybhalla22 July 20239.5. Let me establish some context before I present my review. I went to watch the movie without any expectations, without prior knowledge about Oppenheimer and without even watching the trailer. My love for Christopher Nolan's work and being a huge fan of majority of the film's cast incited me to watch the movie on the first day itself. If I were to give a review in one sentence, it would be ""Either you will truly love this movie or greatly appreciate it but nobody will hate it"". Everything about this movie is top-notch. The casting, cinematography, direction, background score (which will take your breath away) and pretty much everything else is phenomenal with great attention to detail, something which has become a standard for Nolan's work. Just half hour into the movie and I said to myself that I am witnessing something special. There were more than two times in the movie, when I was genuinely left with my mouth wide open and eyes mesmerising at the screen. If you are interested or have spare time at your arsenal, learning something about the life about the main character and World war 2 in general would be helpful, although not compulsory by any means. It will just help you better understand the nuances of the movie and better grasp it without getting overwhelmed with the introduction of different characters. At the end, I would finish the review by saying that this is truly a cinematic experience, which needs to be enjoyed in a movie theatre in order to properly appreciate the great effort that went behind this now critically acclaimed project.0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"Nolan has done it again!heinzketchup-2188126 July 2023""Oppenheimer,"" directed by the visionary Christopher Nolan, is a thought-provoking cinematic journey that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who played a pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. With a stellar cast and exceptional storytelling, Nolan's ambitious project offers audiences an insightful look into the mind of a genius torn between moral obligations and the relentless pursuit of scientific discovery.Set against the backdrop of the tumultuous era of the 1940s, the film presents Cillian Murphy's masterful portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy effortlessly captures the complexity of the man, showcasing Oppenheimer's intelligence, charisma, and unwavering passion for science. The character's inner turmoil is vividly conveyed as he grapples with the implications of his work on the atomic bomb, questioning the potential catastrophic consequences of its deployment.From the very first frame, the film's cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema takes center stage, creating a visually stunning spectacle that enhances the storytelling. The grandeur of the scientific world and the intimate struggles faced by Oppenheimer are both captured with meticulous attention to detail. The sprawling landscapes of Los Alamos and the tense laboratory scenes further immerse the audience in both the scientific genius and the moral dilemmas that haunt the protagonist.True to Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling style, ""Oppenheimer"" weaves together key events from Oppenheimer's life in a non-chronological order. This approach adds layers of depth to the narrative, illustrating how the past, present, and future intermingle in the mind of this enigmatic figure. The director skillfully juxtaposes Oppenheimer's personal relationships, political pressures, and the weight of history to highlight their profound impact on his decisions and actions.The supporting cast delivers strong performances that complement Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer. Marion Cotillard shines as Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer, the physicist's supportive yet complex wife, who provides valuable emotional insights into her husband's struggles. Michael Caine portrays Richard Tolman, Oppenheimer's trusted advisor, with gravitas and wisdom, while Kenneth Branagh brings an authoritative presence to General Leslie Groves, the military leader overseeing the Manhattan Project.While ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic triumph in many respects, its dense narrative and extensive exploration of historical events may prove challenging for some viewers to follow. The film demands an engaged and attentive audience, and casual moviegoers might find themselves overwhelmed by its intricate plot and philosophical undertones.Nolan's portrayal of the Manhattan Project, while compelling, leaves some critics desiring a deeper exploration of the ethical implications surrounding Oppenheimer's work. While the film does not shy away from addressing the moral quandaries, some argue that it could have gone further in examining the profound and far-reaching consequences of the atomic bomb.Despite these minor critiques, ""Oppenheimer"" remains a visually captivating and intellectually stimulating cinematic experience. Nolan's direction guides the audience through a complex web of historical events and personal struggles, effectively capturing the essence of Oppenheimer's brilliance and humanity.At its core, ""Oppenheimer"" raises questions about the role of scientists and their ethical responsibilities in the face of groundbreaking discoveries. It serves as a timely reminder of the potential consequences when the pursuit of knowledge is not tempered by ethical considerations.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a compelling and intellectually engaging film that offers an intimate portrait of a man who played a crucial role in shaping history. Christopher Nolan's direction, Cillian Murphy's outstanding performance, and the stunning visuals make it a must-watch for history enthusiasts and fans of thought-provoking cinema. Despite its occasional narrative complexities, the film successfully navigates the delicate balance between exploring Oppenheimer's brilliance and the ethical dilemmas that continue to resonate in our world today.4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"Masterclass in directionsridhar-e22 July 2023Oppenheimer is a masterclass in movie direction but for an average movie aficionado, it's a decent movie with stunning sound design and masterful acting. I am a huge Nolan fan and even with so much hype, he still doesn't disappoint. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is devastatingly magnificent and is extremely well supported by every single one of the cast including good actors playing small cameos. The sound design was one of the best I have heard in recent times. What impressed me the most was the restraint and subtlety exercised while telling this story. In hands of any other director, this could have very easily become a jingoistic and pathos-inducing average movie. So many of Nolan's stories work because of the emotions and bonds behind all the other stuff but i found that part a bit lacking here and that would be my only critique. For me it's a 9.5 movie but for a normal movie goer it would be 7.5-8 movie.1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Go watch this now!!!yhulstaert19 July 2023This is the first ever IMDB review that I write because I need to give this movie my stars. The camera work is amazing. The cast is amazing and the story is even better. The only downside was the fast pacing wich you may see as a positive thing and the use op a lot of different names for characters. The use of those names was somethimes a little confusing but it does not really affect the story as it is always clear after some thime who they are referring to. Me and my friend just sat there in the cinema after the movie was done. Both baffeled by what happend and the ending. I got goosebumps 3 times from some moments in the movie, never had that before in my life. I have read some negative reviews wich say it was boring.... The only thing they think is not boring is dangeling from a thin wire above a 30meter drop or something but this movie was not even close to boring.14 out of 30 found this helpful.

"Epic and brilliantly crafted.Batman900321 July 20239. Christopher Nolan proves once again that he is one of the most prolific filmmakers of our time. This biographical drama is brilliantly crafted, epic in scope, and has powerful storytelling anchored with a very well-rounded cast. The way he crafts this film on a terrifying subject is beautiful and intense.The sound design is hard hitting and awesomely loud. Yes, you can hear most of dialogue and doesn't get drowned out like it did in ""Tenet"". Ludwig Goransson creates a haunting soundtrack to help the film feel alive and horrifying.Cillian Murphy is mesmerizing in his powerhouse performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer. His acting is very expressive with his facial expressions and mannerisms. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, and especially Robert Downey Jr. Are all standouts as well. Hoyte van Hoytema cinematography is a wonderful sight to behold. They shot this with Imax cameras on real film as opposed to the overused digital format. Nolan wants you to experience this in the theater the way it's meant to be. Kodak also invented the first ever black and white Imax film for this movie.It's not a completely perfect film. It does run for about three hours long, but it's well earned. It's a slow burn, densely filled drama that will turn off some of the mainstream movie goers. Some of the other big-name stars have a limited amount of screentime. Hopefully, this will be one of the front runners for the Oscars. Nolan painted a wonderful picture about the birth of nuclear warfare, atomic bombs, fear, death, and the possibility of destroying the earth.So now it's time to give Nolan his long, overdue Oscar for directing. How he wasn't even nominated for ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"" is baffling.3 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Oppenheimer"" takes you on a guilt trip through the mind of a scientist.saikirandubbakka27 July 2023I just had to share my thoughts on ""Oppenheimer."" In my opinion, it is hands down the best film of 2023 so far, truly ending the first half of the year with a bang. For the past three months, I've been yearning for some quality content, but most movies have been either too commercial or just plain lackluster.The wait for ""Oppenheimer"" was completely worthwhile, and I won't spoil the plot for you in this review. It's a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer, but what sets it apart is Christopher Nolan's exceptional treatment of the subject matter. This is far from a popcorn flick; it delves deep into character study, making you feel like you're inside Oppenheimer's head, experiencing what he goes through. It's a guilt trip for a scientist who created something that changed the world forever and how we are at fingertip/button away from explosion.I must say, Nolan outdid himself in many scenes, making this, in my opinion, his best work as a director to date. The second half, especially after the trinity test, had some of my favorite moments, with the court drama unfolding brilliantly, and the ending haunting and thought-provoking.The screenplay was brilliantly executed, presented from a first-person perspective that allowed me to deeply invest in Oppenheimer's character and yearn to learn more about him. Nolan's choice in this aspect was reminiscent of his earlier film ""Memento.""The cast was outstanding, with Robert Downey Jr. Delivering a surprising and impressive performance, especially after his role in ""Zodiac."" Cillian Murphy was a force to be reckoned with, as always, and even Gary Oldman as Truman and the special mentions to Jeana did an excellent job.The music, composed by Ludwig, was simply mind-blowing. I was already awestruck by his work in ""Tenet,"" and now he brings an amazing score to ""Oppenheimer"" that haunts and adds an eerie atmosphere to the film.This movie is screenplay-heavy and demands attention to detail. Experiencing it in IMAX is highly recommended, particularly for the trinity test scene, which is mind-blowing. But it's not a film for those seeking heavy CGI and dramatic theater experiences. So, if that's what you're expecting, it's best to avoid it.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" will leave you deep in thought and silence for quite a while after watching it. It's an emotional rollercoaster that leaves a lasting impact.4 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Perfectmuhammadmoiz-7394719 July 2023I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.Perfect experience.9 out of 18 found this helpful.

"Sound editing is the real hero of this filmShaanChaudhry21 July 2023A solid film by Nolan but it is worth mentioning to some that if you're expecting action you will be tremendously disappointed. This is a biography of Oppenheimer that focuses on key moments of his life. What drove this movie for me was the top notch quality of acting and the sound/compositions which were instrumental in bringing out the drama within a lot of the dialogue and the acting chops throughout the movie. Please be warned that the overwhelming majority of this movie is dialogue.While both Interstellar and Inception were extremely deep films from Nolan(and in my opinion his best work), there was a popcorn quality about those films where you could loosen up and not take the experience too seriously and still find it entertaining. With Oppenheimer you better pay close attention to the dialogue and what's going on because you will be lost. With that being said it is rewarding getting a glimpse of the drama surrounding the development of nuclear weapons, some of the darkest times in human history. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer will be his defining role of a lifetime. The acting from the cast was flawless along with the brilliant sound editing. I expect this film will be force to be reckoned with at the Oscars.46 out of 74 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Overall a disappointing experience.WhiteRabbitDave28 July 2023Although the time passed quickly, ultimately, Oppenheimer has left me disappointed. The problem with this film is that it can't decide which story it tries to tell - building the bomb or the inquiry of the national security committee. Both of those stories are depicted well, Nolan uses nice narrative devices to locate the characters in their currently depicted temporal location, etc. However, the cheap moral that the film concludes with has been beaten to death and because of that it undermines everything the script tried to achieve. The film didn't leave me speechless and a rather poorly executed sequence of the denotation doesn't really justify the historic development of a black and white IMAX film stock.44 out of 68 found this helpful.

The scenes are also not necessary and not important for the movie. So it feels me like someone told nolan to make a movie about the atomb bomb and he did it like that by highlight how america is great and all the others should be scared from them.However, it is good to see how americans react to successful atomb bomb by smiling, celebrating, being honored and pride. They even do not care how much people died.Cillian murph is acting great and i really like the ending but anyways everytime i said that i should watch it again in the cinema but i did not say these words after this oppenheimer.0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The differentiation between of the black and white and color scenes added tremendous depth to the film.

There were some quirky dialogue lines throughout the film, but were easily washed out by the sheer beauty of the cinematography and performances by the rest of the characters.

I feel like the only people who are honestly rating this a 10 haven't ever pondered on their own the true implications of nuclear weapons and MAD. There was Nothing thought provoking about it. It was long and mostly boring. There's no reason not to wait and see it from home... Unless you want to see an 8 person meeting room on the big screen for an hour and half that is.The acting was of course quite good and deserves to be recognized.

" hours of talking and I was not boredRaidersOfTheLostCommunist23 July 2023Yes, this is a 3 hour movie with 99.9% talking, the other 0.1% is stuff involving bombs or chemical reactions. I would say I was not bored in this movie. I went in knowing its gonna be 3 damn hours, but Nolan did a great job of pacing, the music really helped make this movie not a snooze-fest. Also, do not go in expecting to see explosions and all this war stuff, there is not a single image of war in this film, which is a great choice. Minor spoiler but they don't test the atomic bomb until pass the 2 hour mark.If you are interested in the subject matter like me, you will find a really well done and perfectly acted film. There is not really a lot to complain about, but I feel this movie is best watched with subtitles since there are a lot of talking, a lot of names, a lot of accents, and sometimes you can't really hear what is being said because of the loud music.I would go and even say this is Nolan's best film since Inception, which has gotten better over the years in my opinion. I would love to re-watch this again with subtitles. Also the acting is great, and awesome to see Josh Harnett back. He really is an underrated actor.Anyways I say 9 because even though it is 3 hours long, it still felt like stuff was missing at certain points, Oppenheimer's wife barely had any characters, they jump two years in time and it didn't really feel like that was done smoothly.Anyways, a great film, 9.3 out of 10 found this helpful.

"Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.andysaleen-0530521 July 2023Oppenheimer was just okay-good. It felt much too rushed at times, much too slow at others, but always forced.Though the acting was stellar, the movie itself was a long, jerky, scattered bio-pic that tried to do a little too much at the expense of being a great.I left feeling too many important themes were just glossed and insufficiently explored for a movie of this magnitude.Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.But it's always cool to see physicists, scientists, and math legends (and their famous egos) get screen time. The star studded cast and their incredible performances was the saving grace, but even they could only do so much to save the awkward pacing and complex themes left on the table, barely touched.26 out of 31 found this helpful.

"Bloated but full of greatnessguvvernerr21 July 2023My first impression of Oppenheimer was just how loud it all was. Not to criticize the beautiful tones found throughout, but the heaviness and intensity of the music never relented, except for an inevitable central sequence when we finally, mercifully, get a moment of silence. Silence between the pieces of score, and silence between hours of continuous, hyper-paced dialogue and sound design, which all combined sometimes approaches cacophony.The noise of it all sometimes seems an attempt to compensate for a misplaced idea that an audience wouldn't be able to sustain interest in this material without the distraction of a continuous soundtrack. I wish it would have appreciated more moments of quiet. And ironically, in spite of its relentlessness, Oppenheimer ends up the slowest, and most demanding of all Christopher Nolan films.This is not a bad thing. This film is full of smart, engrossing material and succeeds as a rich retelling of Oppenheimer's legacy and the vast network of brains who helped make his Manhattan Project a reality. Multiple viewings are warranted. The cast is spectacular and good use is overall made of them (when we can pin an actor down long enough to even notice their presence), and I can't really blame Nolan anyway, for wanting to spruce up hours of granular physics, debates and testimony into something as awesome as possible.Nolan's movies are gorgeous contraptions, made with exquisite care and a love of an old school sort of practical filmmaking, and they're always ambitious, always outsized. This movie left me with an odd feeling, which is that it was both too long and not long enough. Not long enough to really pierce the enormous scope of what Oppenheimer's life stood for against history, and yet full and stylized almost beyond the brim.3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"Oppenheimer: An Overhyped Epic That Falls Short on Expectations and Overstays its Welcometim_d324 July 2023Tries to do too much in its three-hour run time. It should have been a much tighter 90-minute narrative.The film attempts to weave together too many stories, topics, and characters, resulting in a convoluted and cluttered narrative. The story might have been better suited to a mini-series format, similar to HBO's ""Chernobyl.""Historic characters, including prominent physicists, are portrayed in a ham-fisted, over-the-top manner that lacks authenticity.9 out of 16 found this helpful.

"Apprehensions of dreams! Oppenheimer Guaranteed Oscar for Nolan?4liReza25 July 2023Undoubtedly, for all cinema lovers, Oppenheimer was one of the most anticipated films of this year, and for me, it was the most anticipated.A movie that I go with great excitement to watch it in Imax Laser and Just as I expected, the cinema was full of people and the interesting thing for me was that I feel the excitement for watching the movie among the audience.Well, it must be said that this movie is an important movie Newlin's most political film with a very special story that takes courage to tell such stories In terms of acting, it is one of the most star-studded films I have seen That is, the actor who won the Oscar just a few years ago He is in this movie for a few minutes Everyone played their role in the best condition and with their highest ability I really thought a guy who was a physicist would cut women out of his life completely But no, Oppenheimer built an atomic bomb, and he's an atomic bomb in bed! :)) This film has a part of about 15 minutes and tries to depict the explosion of the atomic bomb.It's scary, it's so visually suspenseful in terms of sound, which was really amazing Of course, since most of the film's hype was about bomb blasts, I personally expected more from the bomb blast sequence.Which is understandable due to not using special effects.The film is not only about the atomic bomb, but also about the character of Oppenheimer, as the name suggests.The moment of the atomic bomb explosion that ends is not like you say, ok, the climax of the movie is over, there is no more interesting place Oppenheimer's feeling after the atomic bomb explosion is more important than the atomic bomb itself Not using special effects here has limitations that have negative and positive points that I will not mention to avoid spoilers.The soundtrack of the film is definitely one of the masterpieces of the cinema and one of the main chances of Oscar, and we all know that the soundtrack is important for Nolan and an integral part of his films, and in this film, music was played in the background in almost all the sequences.If I want to say briefly When I came out from the cinema, this movie was a complete knockout for me, it opened my brain like a twisted plutonium core and made me stare at the cinema screen until the end credits!The film is a character study on the grandest scale, with an excellent central performance by Cillian Murphy. An epic historical drama but with a distinctly Nolan sensibility that makes it remarkable for its tension, structure, sense of scale, amazing sound design, special effects.This film can be called an amazing achievement in honest adaptation, conciseness, innovative storytelling and subtle performances by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon and many others in it.The audience will be completely attracted to Oppenheimer in this film. A dense, talky, tense film, partly about the bomb, and mostly about how doomed we are. Murphy is good in this movie, but the support from Damon, Downey Jr. And Pugh is essential. A daring, innovative and complex film that shakes its audience.You will be amazed and emotionally destroyed after watching this movie. I think it's going to be a stunning artistic achievement and I hope it really sparks a national and even global conversation about the issues that Oppenheimer was so passionate about. This movie is about how to live in the atomic age and shows how to be patriotic. The film also explains the role of a scientist in a society immersed in technology and science to talk about public issues.Oppenheimer is... incredible. The word that keeps coming to mind is scary. Nolan has crafted a relentlessly paced, intricately detailed historical drama.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Close to perfection...satoreviews21 July 2023This is my first review ever and as a big Nolan fan I have never come to write any on some of his other phenominal films but I have finally decided to write a short review to highlight Oppenheimers work of art.To start with, Cillian Murphy is just excellent and is everything I hoped for - he truly embodied J. Robert Oppenheimer. R. D. J. After many years in the Marvel universe has returned with a bang! Matt Damon was also great and I particularly enjoyed Murphy's and Damon's character dynamics and dialogues together.The dense screenplay is oscar worthy. The film however is quite dialogue heavy but is made up for by the breathtaking cinematography and the well-written script.Lastly, I have always believed that music is what moves us emotionally during a film. Ludwig Göransson has yet again created an absolutely thrilling and suspenseful score thats flows extremely well with the films pace and aura. These are my personal favourites - give them a listen if you haven't already!: ""Can You Hear The Music"", ""Meeting Kitty"", ""Manhattan Project"", ""American Prometheus"", ""Trinity"", ""Something More Important"", ""Destroyer of Worlds"", ""Oppenheimer"".And yes... Of course I am writing this review whilst listening to the soundtrack.6 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Oppenheimer Will Win it Allstdoar26 July 2023This. Will. Win. Everything. Under. The. Sun. Whether all the credit goes to Cillian Murphy's brillance or to Nolan for tapping Cillian, we may never know. But both combine for something that will go unmatched for a long time. An honest biopic about Robert Oppenheimer that doesn't provide any answers because there are no easy answers. Instead, it lends to the audience a masterwork of a story worth pondering over & over. This goes above Nolan's past best works in Dunkirk and Inception, not only due to the refined wizardry of Nolan's genius but also to the nature of what the film sets out to explore -- that momentous juncture in human history when we couldn't mathmatically rule out that we, as humanity, could destroy ourselves in the very attempt to save ourselves--with all of our human complexicites webbed throughout.2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"The Power To Destroy The WorldMisterJxroen20 July 2023Me and a few of my friends saw Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" on opening night, in the IMAX format for which this film was intended. The feeling I have after having watched this film is something I can't really describe, nor do I know how I feel about the film as a whole. I feel as if this movie doesn't directly try to tell you whether or not Oppenheimer was a good or bad person, but allows one to decide this for their own. Same with the dilemma of building such a weapon of mass destruction.I think the visual portrayal of the atomic bomb was magnificent. The buildup to this moment was nerve-wrecking and really put me on the edge of my seat. And when it finally happened; quietness. It was the silence before the storm. For a moment, we get to see the beauty of it, and then we are hit with all the destruction and pain that can come with it; the shockwave. And I felt it coming too!We as an audience get to see it mostly from Oppenheimer's perspective, as I understand it. He doesn't look at the grand scale of it, but instead seems to recognize his dreams (and nightmares) in this phenomenon; the atoms and molecules floating around in harmony, just like he envisioned.I disliked the frequent and abrupt cutting between scenes and missed some prolonged, quieter scenes. Lee Smith's (previous editor for Nolan) absence is definitely felt throughout the film. This film also misses another genius who has frequently partnered with Nolan; Hans Zimmer. Though the soundtrack isn't on his level, Ludwig Göransson managed to deliver a beautiful score full of emotion and suspense. I'm yet to listen to it on Spotify since it hasn't released yet, but I know it'll be a great listen.The acting was splendid from every star that featured in this film-which were a lot. Cillian Murphy in the lead role is obviously a standout, and I wouldn't be surprised if this role lands him a lead actor Oscar (nomination). Another standout for me personally is Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Lewis Strauss. I don't know anything about Strauss, but Robert felt like an amazing fit for the role.I don't know how much of this story is completely factual, but I was intrigued and interested by it nonetheless. I can't wait to do more research about the subject matter, just like I can't wait to learn about how Nolan managed to make this film without CGI. I'm still processing this film, so for now my rating remains at a solid eight stars. Definitely an incredible thrill that one must face on the big screen.4 out of 11 found this helpful.

"Leaves much to be desired.ThunderQunt25 July 2023Quite a frustrating watch to be honest. Being a big fan of biopics, history, war, science, and Nolan, this film was going to be one to remember fondly. But it is not the case. As the film ends, I'm only thinking how it leaves much more to be desired.Oppenheimer - a character study interspersed with events surrounding the Manhattan Project which feels more like a minor secondary plot. Unemotional and rather jarring to the point where one might be tempted to use the word boring were the political and courtroom plots. By trying to blend in two stories, one being the Manhattan Project and the other being the political/courtroom drama, it fails to deliver on both sides. Can't help but think it would do much much better just focusing on one or the other. Deliver 100% on one story rather than 50% on two mushed in ones. Personally, I feel much more excited whenever the story progresses on the Manhattan Project-side - the building of the bomb, the work differences of the scientists/military/politicians, the morals, the ethical dilemmas, the politics of the project. The film builds on those aspects then, deflates into the courtroom-like scenes, taking steam off any real weight, emotions, and connections.However, it's not all bad. Nolan delivers on the technical filmmaking and the cast delivers on the acting. Film and filmmaking lovers will have much to enjoy and awards are almost guaranteed I dare say. The acting was the best part of the whole film. Needless to say, Cillian Murphy delivers as Oppenheimer himself and as many, many others mentioned, Robert Downey Jr. Also stands out.All in all, it still is a Christopher Nolan film and it shows. Though, it leaves much to be desired for as it aspired to be much more but can't. Just like my life.1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A relentless rideethiotst-5311024 July 2023I need to make two things clear. One, this film is not for everyone and certainly wouldn't appeal to more casual movie goers. It is an in-depth character study of Oppenheimer and is entirely about his life and is not a film about the bomb. If you wanted a thriller about the trinity test this film is not it, they don't start making the bomb until nearly an hour into the film, with the actual test happening with about an hour left of the film. The film isn't particularly exciting either but very interesting and definitely entertaining. It is thought-provoking not action-packed.The other thing I need to make clear is that I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan. I don't think he has made a bad film or even just okay film in his entire career (granted I haven't yet seen Following or Insomnia). I enjoyed Tenet even though it was too confusing and liked Dark Knight Rises despite its plot holes. So it isn't a stretch to say I would have liked this film whether it was deemed good or bad by most people. I also had astronomical expectations for this film. I admittedly got carried away with the hype which is something people shouldn't do because the majority of times the movie, game or whatever it is isn't going to be as good as your unreasonable expectations. Which is why I'm glad to say Oppenheimer met my expectations. Is it a masterpiece? I don't know, that phrase is thrown around too much, but it is one of the best films I've ever watched and a film like no other I had seen before.The pacing of this film is ridiculous. It's at a running pace the entire film and at times feels like the flow of a trailer. This is not a bad thing. Everything important you need to know is very hard to miss. That said, you do need your entire brain focusing on this film to take it all in and appreciate it. The speed of the film means it never feels too long like The Hobbit films and actual flies by quite quickly. I have only seen the film once but I am planning to go again and I can guarantee I will find more details and understand the story more in my second maybe third viewing. But you don't need to watch the film multiple times to understand it, like I said before everything is made very clear what is happening, just make sure your listening to the dialogue.This film is completely made up of dialogue, there is no action in the entire film. Some people would find this boring which is understandable. The dialogue is very well written and is delivered perfectly by all the actors, there's nothing more I can say really. But one important thing to mention is the sound mixing. This was a huge complaint for Tenet, rightfully so, and I saw some people saying the issue was present in Oppenheimer as well. For me it was fine. I saw it at the BFI Imax and there were something like two lines of dialogue I struggled to hear (I have since watched the film again at a different cinema and I defiantly struggled to hear the dialogue at the start of the film). Most people seemed to be complaining about the start being hard to hear but it was fine for me.A lot of people in the promotion of this film have said that this is the ultimate film to see in Imax. Whilst I don't disagree, the best way to see this film is on 70mm Imax and there are plenty of truly wow moments seeing it on a screen that big, I don't think it is as necessary as implied. Although I didn't see it in Imax, Interstellar seems like it would be a much better film for Imax than Oppenheimer. This doesn't mean you shouldn't see it at the biggest screen you can. Watching it at the BFI Imax was an unreal experience and you truly get immersed with the stunning cinematography and the booming score.Ludwig Goransson's score is his best yet. It compliments the film perfectly. I find it a bit hard to describe it without going needlessly in depth on all the musical features that make it so good. Lots of people has wanted Hans Zimmer and Nolan to continue working together again. I love Zimmer's work and have seen his performances live but I can assure you that Goransson is an amazing composer as well and could definitely be the next big film composer for the years to come.The cast is ridiculous as well. The cast is completely stacked with Cillian Murphy, RDJ, Matt Damon (who came out of a break from acting when he got the call from Nolan), Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh. There are big name actors who have just a few lines in the entire film some of them only being in a single scene, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck. Cillian Murphy is perfect as Oppenheimer, not only do they loom alike but he also really conveys the emotions and regret that Oppenheimer faced. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an amazing performance but not quite as good as some people are making it out to be. Don't get me wrong he is amazing I just feel like Emily Blunt is the best supporting actor. There is one moment near the end where she very nearly steals the show and is probably one of my favourite moments in the film.As in every film that involves science, when they explain a lot of it goes over your head. I was surprised to see that Oppenheimer handled that complicated science aspect really well. I have little knowledge of quantum physics just the very basics and I found myself understanding what they are saying at a simple level. They never dive in deep explaining the tricky stuff as well which is really good for the audience. I don't know if it was just me that found the science possible to grasp at and understand.The structure of the film can be slightly confusing. In typical Nolan style, it is non-linear. Three distinct parts of Oppenheimer's story are told throughout the film. One part is black and white, after the trinity test. Another is in what is effectively a court room but not technically one. And the other part which takes up the majority of the film is the chronological events of Oppenheimer's life. It is fairly easy to follow but there are a few black and white scenes that you can't obviously tell when they happened. One thing I liked that they did was that as the chronological life of Oppenheimer caught up to the black and white scenes after the bomb it would become colour. Its a nice touch that helps you understand what is going on.You can't talk about the film without mentioning the bomb. It is the climax of the film and the countdown to its detonation is so well done. The tension, dread, worry that everyone feels is very effectively portrayed to the point where I think the build up the bomb is better than the actual explosion. The explosion is by far the best nuke scene I have seen in a movie but I think the build-up is better in terms of the effect it has on you. The explosion itself is definitely the best looking nuke I have ever seen, with the film benefiting from Nolan's practical effects. At the time of the explosion you just feel this terrified awe as the perfectly shot bomb goes off. There's also a bit of a jump scare in this bit that took me by surprise.I could talk about more but I would be spoiling the movie. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, have a great day.I have now watched the film a second time in a smaller cinema and it was just as good an experience as the first time. The film is definitely better in IMAX now I can compare to a regular screen.5 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"One of the best Biographical movies of all time!!!sagartiptur26 July 2023I watched this movie both in English and Hindi languages,and no doubt this could become one of the highest grossing R rated movies.Positives of the movie is Christopher Nolan's screenplay,direction, performances of the lead cast and soundtrack. These type of movies would easily become slow paced and dull,what makes this movie interesting is fast paced editing, brilliantly crafted non linear story telling.It's true that this movie is not for everyone, but everyone is on for watching it.

"Speechlessdmustang-4653223 July 2023Oppenheimer was a great and very well crafted historical interpretation from Chris Nolan. Even as someone who doesn't know the ins and outs of this particular era of history, this movie served as a great look into the past. I had been waiting to see this movie for months ever since I heard it was going to be released in July. I think that with other movies that are highly anticipated sometimes they let you down even if they aren't that bad, it's just because they weren't perfect. In this case the anticipation was not a problem and after the movie I can wholeheartedly say this is one of if not the best movie I've ever seen, not only in theatres but ever.Cinematography: 10 Acting: 10 Everything else 10.1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Oppen-bore-merdweston-3866925 July 2023Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.25 out of 39 found this helpful.

"A Terrific Film Nearly Vaporized By Special Effectsmsbensley-4452930 July 2023The acting in Oppenheimer is outstanding, from the top of the cast, through supporting actors, to the nearly and actually uncredited.Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan felt it necessary to remind us that the film is about The Bomb every three minutes. The special effects were very well done, but maybe deserving of its own Oscar (who's going to out-soecial-effect an atomic bomb?)Apparently Nolan didn't trust his cast enough to carry the film, which was a huge error. Nolan's direction of the cast, and their performances would have been enough to win a Best Picture without any more than a single flash of light and a BOOM. Let's just hope the incessant booms and overexposures don't wear out the Oscar committee.1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"One of Nolan's Best Films! Possibly His Best?!mitchell595429 July 2023Oppenheimer is the latest film by Christopher Nolan about the legendary J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb. Of all the films coming out this year, this was the one I was most hyped for by a wide margin. I've been hyped for this movie for a couple of years really. Mainly because it's by Christopher Nolan. I have to say, it was worth the wait and hype. I'd say this was Nolan's best film, at least since the Dark Knight.I have to say, the films he's done in the past decade plus have not been stellar. Don't get me wrong, Interstellar, Dunkirk, and Tenant are all fine enough, but they don't really measure up to his early work. Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and Inception I'd say are his golden years (the Prestige was good too). I'm glad to say that this film ranks up there with those films. In fact, Oppenheimer might be my favorite movie he's done. I have to think about that, but right now it's between this and The Dark Knight as his best for me.Like every Nolan production, the film looks and sounds stellar. The film is well-acted by everybody, especially Cillian Murphy. It's nice to see him finally getting a lead role in a Nolan production after being in so many of them already. Other standouts in the film are Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon. It's also nice to see Downey make a comeback after his last disaster of a film, Dolittle.If you're a major Nolan fan like me, you need to see this on the big screen if able. However, this is not a film for everyone. This is not a blockbuster crowd pleaser, but a long, somber character biopic, with some explicit sexual content thrown in. One scene in particular sex scene did feel a bit unnecessary. I understand what Nolan was going for, but it just felt bizarre and took me out of the rest of the scene a bit. But it was just one little moment. Hardly enough to ruin anything for me, but it might make some uncomfortable.3 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"The Man. Who Moved. The Earth.dorMancyx26 July 2023The rain halts. Scent of dampened soil permeates, soon to be overwhelmed by that of sweat and lumber. Crimson are the signal lights, as if candles ignited for a sacred ritual, guiding all attention to the dark tower. Simple words are spoken, but at the volume of infinity; the music crescendos. Afar, soldiers lay low in postures of worshipping, solemnity in the eyes behind black goggles. The hatted man nods, the hand quivers, the number zeros. There is silence, and then, there is light.Such is the sequence that glued me to my chair and infatuated me with Nolan's artistry. Despite getting crushed by Barbie in box office, Oppenheimer, in my opinion, is a work of sincerest dedication, and will be remembered as a biographical film of the highest standard.I have no technical term that summarizes Nolan's directing genius, but the result speaks for itself: rhythmically engrossing narration, temporally convoluted storylines, and intriguingly concise buildup. At first, the exposition seems hasty and aimless to me, with too many dangling threads, yet Nolan manages to return to every of those planted seeds at the most unexpected but appropriate timing, sewing individual strings into the most ravishing of embroideries. Per usual, aestheticism, editing, and soundtrack are spot-on --- I do see area of improvement for the last one though, as there is no motivic melody that sticks, just ambient accompanies.A lot more could be said about the movie's philosophy, but personally it all centers around the word ""contradiction"". Oppenheimer is a contradicted man whether in terms of romance, belief, or ethic. His tragedy is his humanhood: human to bare unparalleled intelligence, to bare collective ambitions, and to bare the entirety of guilt. Although imperfect, at least Oppenheimer realizes that all that has happened is above him or his colleagues, which makes him spiritually superior to Strauss, who is limited to mere fame and ego.Phenomenal film, but definitely not a commercial one. I hope Oscar gives Nolan and Murphy some recognition this time.3 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Mini serie would have been a better way to goh-i-hussain722 July 2023First off, the dialogues are actually audible, quite clear, happy that they mended this in comparison to Nolan's last outing Tenet.Secondly, a captivating story told in a even more captivating way.The acting is perhaps best of the year so far, Oscar nominations galore.I saw it on a digital IMAX screen, very pristine and filmy.Sound, cinematography and score are stand outs too.Only thing is, this film would have been a even better mini series.The run time and intense dialogues/ intrigues can be quite draining to the viewer.As a Dutchman I noticed that, Oppenheimer did not speak Dutch in the film, it sounded like an Irishman trying to speak German.

"Christopher Nolan's odd choices ruined the movie once againFlak3622 July 2023I'm beginning to think that Nolan has self-esteem issues and desperately tries to prove how deep, special and different he is. Hey look! Non-linear structure of the story to confuse you! Deafening sound mixing to destroy your ears! And no CGI! Can you imagine that bro? A modern film with no CGI! That's how special Nolan tries to be! By the way, there is CGI in the movie. They just lie to him that it's all VFX compositing of photoreal elements.Yet another movie with a non-linear narrative so confusing that I could only suspect what's going on without being certain. I walked out about 30 minutes before it ended and one friend who was considering to watch it asked for my opinion. I literally didn't know what to say initially: ""It's about building the atomic bomb. That's basically it.""I said the same things in my review for Dunkirk (which is not really Dunkirk but soldiers standing on a beach like ghosts). The constant back and forth in time, along with the terrible sound mixing ruin what could have been a fantastic movie. If the project was headed by anyone else it could have been one of my favourite movies.The explosion of the bomb was the only thing I enjoyed and we've all seen images of it online. I didn't have to pay for it. I know this was the last Nolan movie I paid for because he will always mess with the time and sound, desperately trying to appear edgy and special.6 out of 12 found this helpful.

"Don't expect traditional Nolan thrillsrdowd9323 July 2023Oppenheimer is very much a beautifully shot, edited and scored achievement in filmmaking. However, this movie, either by design or unintentionally is not as gripping or thrilling as other Nolan movies. Perhaps, the audience should have expected this given that it was marketed as a biopic. But, still, with Nolan at the helm, I expected more suspense. The stakes of the Manhattan project were existential, yet that feeling of existentialism was lacking throughout the film. Cillian Murphy's performance was masterful, but I don't feel that I learned anything of substance about the subject he was portraying.7 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Deserves all the hype and all the accolades in the future! Oscars, here we come!aadarshstha-9256521 July 2023A cinematic spectacle. Oppenheimer is yet another masterclass filmmaking and storytelling from non other than, Christopher Nolan and he has crafted one of the greatest biopics of all time.In his own words, ""J. Robert Oppenheimer, the most important person who ever lived"". This film has exceptional storytelling and mad genius cinematography. Christopher Nolan is a very intelligent person himself, he has proven it since his first film, Following and have given such thought-provoking films like Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar and Tenet. With this, Nolan has proven to be a master at filmmaking taking inspiration from the 2005 book, American Prometheus.This film fires dialogue packed with historical information at a relentless pace and jumps to various times in Oppenheimer's life continuously (from his own perspective as well as Lewis Strauss' perspective) throughout it's 3 hour runtime. The star-studded cast gives phenomenal performance, even a small role has been done by the big name in Hollywood; this proves how big of a name is Nolan and how actors would do anything to work with him.The career best performance from Cillian Murphy must be the highlight of the film but I was really surprised with the final act and how important of a role is of Mr. Downey Jr. The final hour of the film must be the most intense in the film about the atomic bomb. As it unravels, my heart was pounding out of my chest!Aesthetically beautiful cinematography, exceptional performance and terrifying soundtracks.I was stunned looking at the visuals. A great milestone for film industry, as a whole. This film will be remembered throughout, at least for it's visual milestone.4 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Flawed and complicated people create a flawed and complicated history.Imshortok0623 July 2023Oppenheimer Review: Very good movie, but be forewarned: it's long (3 hours) and very dialogue-heavy. People who aren't interested in history, who are distracted very easily, and who expect a lot of action will be disappointed. Every movie-making and storytelling aspect hit the mark. The cinematography, the musical score, the depth of characterization were all good. I only have one criticism, which is that the jumbled chronology of scenes made it kind of confusing for someone who wasn't paying attention or for someone who didn't have a basic knowledge of the story. However, the black and white shots coupled with the various location settings helped with this. Overall, an excellent film with a very important message: History is made by flawed and complicated people, who sometimes do bad things for good reasons, which can have both rewarding and terrible effects.4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Watching a Nolan movie in the cinemas is always an experience of a lifetime and he truly stands by his word of how these movies are meant to the big screen.Oppenheimer is a unique intense storytelling of an important part of world's history mainly through narration and a visual intensity to match with it. The trailer was very well edited and it barely gave anything about the movie. This movie probably may not have the same level of action sequences that most of the Nolan movies have but the adrenaline rush in this movie is served through intense moments between characters paired with classic background score. Ludwig Göransson excels again with the music in this after his collaboration with Nolan on Tenet. This movie probably has the most dialogue I have seen in a Nolan's film. It will take a while to understand where Nolan's going with the narration but the movie's climax makes it all worth it. The movie offers a great visual experience as it shifts through IMAX and normal ratio quite often. The practical efforts put in by the movie crew is clearly seen in the beautiful cinematography. Personally for me, this movie was not as entertaining as Nolan's movies of the past decade or so but it was definitely engaging.Oppenheimer boasts of a tremendous star cast and there is barely anything revealed in the trailer on the same. There are many brilliant actors playing very small but very important roles which I will not say much about. Over the years, Cillian Murphy has evolved into such a great actor and his performance doesn't really surprise the audience on how good it is. He devours the screen as Robert J Oppenheimer and the intensity in his eyes is a treat to watch. Robert Downey Jr's character as Lewis Strauss slowly builds up as the movie goes on and undergoes a unique transformation in the end. Florence Pugh's role left more impact on me than Emily Blunt's although the latter has the more screen time. Matt Damon offers a slightly refreshing shade to this intense film. This movie is indeed highly dependent on the actors and performances, Nolan brings the best and showcases the best as usual.Oppenheimer is yet another gripping tale by Nolan which makes you walk out of the cinema hall with some questions but a lot of retrospection.0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"Doesn't deserve anything higher than an 7.5 on IMDBjakeglassman-0346223 July 2023The movie was okay maybe decent. Are we really going to pretend that we were all at the edge of seats the whole time? I feel like the only people who are honestly rating this a 10 haven't ever pondered on their own the true implications of nuclear weapons and MAD. There was Nothing thought provoking about it. It was long and mostly boring. There's no reason not to wait and see it from home... Unless you want to see an 8 person meeting room on the big screen for an hour and half that is.The acting was of course quite good and deserves to be recognized. I think that RDJ stood out for his part. Honestly this may be the weakest Cillian Murphy role I've seen in the last 10 years. But I think that it's part of the problem. If Oppenheimer was an interesting man, the film failed to show me why.9 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A Fantastic Filmmahmus24 July 2023It wasn't quite the masterpiece I was hoping for, but Oppenheimer is still a really fantastic movie.Cillian Murphy is terrific and the supporting cast is honestly insane. This might beat The Thin Red Line for the amount of big name actors that show up. Robert Downey Jr. Stole the show. I did feel like Emily Blunt was a bit wasted though. She has one really good scene, but she's mostly just the ""wife"" character.The cinematography, editing, music; it's all top-notch, even if most of the visuals don't really make it a ""must see in IMAX"" movie. The detonation sequence is absolutely breathtaking though.It did start to feel a bit overdramatic at points, with plot twists and lots of shouting courtesy of Jason Clarke's almost cartoonishly evil character. Plus there are times where (despite it's uniquely Nolan structure) it does feel like a rather standard biopic, especially in the first act. That feeling doesn't stick for very long though since the whole thing is so well put together.In the end, I would say this is easily one of my favorite Nolan films. It's great to see him tap into more emotional themes, even when there are still some issues. Also, I absolutely loved the ending.6 out of 18 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Cinema is its most visceral formrevparu21 July 2023It's rare to experience a movie like Oppenheimer in the contemporary Hollywood. This is Nolan at his best, using his experience in ways you'd never imagine.You are immediately hypnotised by the chilling soundtrack of Ludwig. The visuals and the brilliant dialogue are breathtaking.With a relentless pace that makes three hours go by inconspicuously. I somehow didn't realise how the last 30 mins of the movie passed by, and yet I felt like it could've used a few extra minutes.Condensing a book like American Prometheus into a 3 hour movie is a great feat.If this is Nolan's attempt at going for an Oscar, I wouldn't necessarily argue it. But I would add that this movie doesn't look like an Oscar bait. It's still got Nolan's touch.5 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Great movie over allaghydkartbeel23 July 2023Had fun watching the movie. It was worth the 3 hours time especially in the cinema. The storytelling skills of Christopher Nolan are incomparable and really you can see them through the movie. At first you get confused why you don't understand, what that happens and that and then the story keep slowly unfolding while also building tension with the viewer as well. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the movie in imax cinema, because we don't have true Imax in Germany, but nonetheless, it was very enjoyable experience and was worth every minute. I would definitely recommend watching the movie if you haven't already.4 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"What an experience!joekeene6422 July 2023Oppenheimer.Wow! Movie was truly an experience. The visuals with the black and white juxtaposed with color throughout and the sound effects were amazing. The use of sound is what really stood out.From the deafening sounds of blasts to the foreboding bass and other instrumentals throughout, the sound really set a great mood for the film.Cillian Murphy killed it with his performance, I think he was Oscar worthy. Robert Downey Jr., also was outstanding. Movie is very long but I felt the pacing worked well and the movie never dragged or got boring.Also loved how morality was highlighted and Oppenheimer's struggle with his own conscience in building the bomb.Best movie I've seen this year.8.1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Watching the film on IMAX is totally worth it.The cast delivered outstanding performances in this film. Cillian Murphy's performance, in particular, stands out as he portrays a complex and emotionally compelling role, capturing the moral dilemmas that Oppenheimer himself faced and those that resonate with us in today's age. His portrayal, facial and eye expressions add depth and authenticity to the character, making it truly impactful and thought-provoking.

"Possibly the best film I have ever seenronaldpj21 July 2023Have been here for quite some time (over 50 years) and have watched my share of very good films, but this might very well take the cake.My previous ""top choices"" were Godfather 1 & 2 and Pulp Fiction, but today I saw Oppenheimer in the cinema and it blew me away. I need some time and maybe a re-viewing to get it all into perspective, but it is such a good film on multiple levels. The story is told in a way that you don't get lost, but you also don't see all the pieces until the director wants you to. The acting is phenomenal (not a surprise with a cast like this) and for me (as someone that grew up during the 70's and 80's) the topic of nuclear war fare and the cold war is something that is very, very relatable. And then there is the cinematography and the sound effects that both tremendously enhance the experience.All in all, it would surprise me if this is not already the biggest contender for double digit number of Academy Awards and in my opinion, deservedly so.4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Brilliant Performances, Brilliant Direction, But a lot to grasptalking_about_movies24 July 2023The much awaited historical entry from one of my favourite directors, Christopher Nolan, is finally out. It's being well received from critics and audiences alike. After watching it, I can say it more or less deserves that reception.I did have the fear of not understanding this movie. Nolan has a habit of making his films as ground-breaking as possible. He doesn't want his movies to feel normal. He speeds up his storytelling and makes his dialogue scenes as brief as possible to keep the audience's brain working the whole time. So yes, in this film too, there are things that I missed. I understood the story, but I missed many character details that were thrown at me very fast in multiple different scenes. And I'm not sure whether this story even needed the non-linear way in which it was told here. You'll need multiple viewings to fully understand this film.Let's now talk about everything else. The story is available through various forms of media already. So I don't think anything new was written into this movie. What this movie had to do though, was to show this existing story. That it did - through brilliant direction, phenomenal performances, jaw-dropping soundtracks and the intensity that all of them brought to the story. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the psychological effects on Oppenheimer, and Nolan's vision made a scintillating combo. In fact there are so many brilliant performances here - Jason Clarke, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, all of them give some intense performances. Ludwig Goransson's score is just chilling (the composer of Black Panther). There are so many scenes here that just gave me goosebumps. There's a scene where Jason Clarke's character is arguing with Oppenheimer, and that entire scene was just amazingly performed and made by everyone. There's also the Trinity test scene which was brilliantly directed by Nolan. There are many such scenes.Overall I do think this is a great movie, but I'll definitely have to watch it again to believe that. It's great to see a historical drama be so successful at the theatres.4 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Overall a disappointing experience.WhiteRabbitDave28 July 2023Although the time passed quickly, ultimately, Oppenheimer has left me disappointed. The problem with this film is that it can't decide which story it tries to tell - building the bomb or the inquiry of the national security committee. Both of those stories are depicted well, Nolan uses nice narrative devices to locate the characters in their currently depicted temporal location, etc. However, the cheap moral that the film concludes with has been beaten to death and because of that it undermines everything the script tried to achieve. The film didn't leave me speechless and a rather poorly executed sequence of the denotation doesn't really justify the historic development of a black and white IMAX film stock.44 out of 68 found this helpful.

"No hyperboles.vedanthjanga22 July 2023My eye did not move away from the screen for a single moment, throughout the 3 hour film, not a single moment. The most immersive experience I've ever had. Literally. It will take you back to the times. Christopher Nolan really managed to visually narrate all the main events of Oppenheimer's life in the most excellent way possible. Think about that, decades of material put into 3 hours. That type of story demands a steady concentration by the audience.While we're talking about thinking, I remembered the ending of this movie. Man. That ending will haunt me and the music throughout not only that scene but also the sound design and editing at the same time are just literal milestones of leveling up a scene. Through the whole movie. It is just perfect.Yes. The ending is perfect. The beginning is engaging to say the least. And the introduction to quantum physics at the beginning is done so divine-ly (makes more sense cause it's from Oppenheimer's POV anyways) and the music played ""Can you hear the music"" just made me fall in love.TLDR for y'all mfs; TRUE CINEMA IS BEING PLAYED ON THE BIGGEST SCREENS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. The correct way you can pay respect is watching it on the biggest screen in your city, you'll be forever grateful for paying that respect which I guarantee, after watching it 3 times.3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Murphy is exceptionalOrlando_Gardner19 July 2023You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.1,413 out of 1,597 found this helpful.

"All surface but no feelingdarrenhrose29 July 2023Nolan rarely does empathy well but this is a soulless three hours of men mumbling at one another. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are wasted and portrayed as damaged souls. Scenes come and go barely registering on your conscience. Watching this movie is a bit like thinking back to you time in school where you were forced by your teachers to watch educational videos which were kind of okay but you'd rather be playing Lego or riding your bike.

"Nolan has now out-Nolaned himself for the second time in a row, with a different set of minor issuesDrTuvok26 July 2023Even though Oppenheimer is far more cohesive and easy-to-appreciate than the divisive Tenet, the two films still share many Nolanisms: the ticking time-bomb scenario, scientific exposition, an intense, panic attack-inducing soundtrack (this is very much a sound-driven film), non-linear storytelling. How Oppenheimer varies from Tenet, and why it's a better film, has something to do with the acting. Cillian Murphy embodies Oppenheimer to the degree that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role, and he's buttressed by an impressive ensemble cast including Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr (what might have been...had he not devoted the best years of his life to Marvel), and many others who will certainly look familiar, meriting a visit to the Wikipedia cast list. It even becomes difficult to keep track of all these characters. Oddly enough there is no Michael Caine.Another point of improvement over Tenet comes, ironically, from the fact that Nolan is reforming what is by now the most stale and unremarkable Hollywood genre of all: the biopic. Oppenheimer has a better idea of what kind of film it is, what story it wants to tell, and how to tell it.That being said, there is something missing in the depiction of Oppenheimer's moral quandary; much like in Luhrmann's recent 'Elvis', the film lacks the knowledge (maybe strength?) to give its protagonist the truly moving, epic/tragic dimension he deserves. The difference is that where Luhrmann was immoral (his Elvis was by turns redeemed and destroyed by profligacy) Nolan is more amoral (generally concerned with physics and technicalities over emotional resonance). Murphy completely sells Oppenheimer's horror at what he's created, but when the film switches to McCarthyist machinations it's anticlimactic, almost beside the point, proving that Nolan is more awestruck by the effects of the Bomb on humanity as a whole instead of on one man. It still works dramatically, (and Nolan's position is far more understandable than Luhrmann's) but, much like in real life, Oppenheimer himself gets a little lost in the magnitude of his work. You feel his pain, understand him, but are not emotionally moved---history merely marches on. It should come as no surprise that Emily Blunt, playing his wife, feels underutilized.Putting all that aside, a striking feature of the film is Nolan's restraint: any other director would be desperate to spice the film up with violence and destruction, but we watch Cillian Murphy's reactions. The real climax of the movie is not Hiroshima, but the Trinity test, and it's here that the old cliche 'it must be seen in the theater' holds true. This scene HAS to be experienced on a huge screen to get the full effect. Home viewing or streaming will not come close to what I sat through in the IMAX theater, and I'll leave it at that.Ultimately Oppenheimer is still a singular, worthwhile experience which I plan to see again in the theater. It goes without saying that it's a better film than the more popular 'Barbie', a movie so ridiculous that even its supporters contradict themselves, saying 'It's just a movie about a doll! You can't take it seriously!' and a few sentences later: 'subversive masterpiece!' Out of these two films, infamously released on the same day, it's easy to tell which one will endure.Another quibble, coming at the expense of sounding too snobbish: Nolan and cinematographer Hoytema are far too obsessed with soft-focus compositions, which make up nearly every shot in the film. The innovative black and white Imax film looks incredible of course, but what's the point if it's shot in the same woozy fashion as the color sequences? One of the main effects of black and white film is an emphasis on shapes, forms, and position, which is how directors such as Orson Welles and John Frankenheimer were able to work such wonders with it. Nolan could have blocked his scenes more creatively and found something even more visually stunning than the practical effect nuclear explosion, but his depth of field is so narrow that it can barely allow two things to be in focus at the same time. This works when we're meant to be getting inside Oppenheimer's head, but for the entire movie?3 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Atomic jump scaresandrewpetrouap27 July 2023Atomically loud jump scares are littered throughout the film. The film immediately starts with a sudden huge noise then plods quietly through barely discernible dialogue until other sudden huge noises occur regularly to inject adrenalin into the audience. The first hour urgently needs sub titles due to the garbled words. This is strange because the first hour had some scientific theory which, if heard better, would have really added to the film.Sudden irrelevant sex scenes occasionally replace the sudden loud noises obviously to break the monotonous talk fest.Some great acting by both major and minor actors. This saved the film from outright boredom and makes it passable. The theme is of such importance that the talk fest is warranted so we can get a better understanding of those times.The musical score was mainly sudden and loud.

"I'll Bet That's Jack Quaid As Richard Feynman Playing The Bongo Drumboblipton23 July 2023I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's work, and this one lived up to his best standards. Covering almost forty years, from Oppenheimer as a student in England and Germany, to the unsatisfying honors of his later years, Nolan, cast and crew, have labored to create a portrait of a man , full of flaws, but smarter than I can imagine, and placed him among other men of similar brilliance in a way that illuminates them all. And like watching Penn & Teller do the cup-and-ball trick, I see exactly what he does and still can't catch him doing it, any more than I recognized Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, who turns into the villain of the piece.It's early to start predicting Oscar nominations, and Nolan's pictures have been slighted in the past. However, one nomination I feel confident about is that Luisa Abel will be nominated for make-up, as she ages her characters through their lifetimes.Nolan's movies encompass big themes and often distorted views of time. This would seem to render them too highbrow for popularity yet they are popular. They challenge the audience without insulting him. They don't indulge in bafflegab to offer a fig leaf to their nonsense, but explain things in terms he can understand (I omit TENET from this discussion), just as the scientists use language they can understand. Nolan as a film maker is the type of craftsman I try to be as a writer: engaging, entertaining, making his points without talking down, and leaving the audience a little happier and more knowledgeable than when he started. My only dissatisfaction with this movie is that he is so much better at his craft than I at mine.12 out of 32 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

The casting, the editing, the acting, the sound, the pacing... I can't think of a single thing wrong with any of these.For anyone who is put off by the runtime, I watched Indiana Jones a week prior to seeing Oppenheimer and although Oppenheimer is just a little bit longer, Indiana Jones was an absolute endurance test to sit through, in comparison. Every second of Oppenheimer feels pivotal to the experience and I almost wasn't ready for it to end.I don't want to say too much because a million other reviews have said it many times over but this is absolutely one of the most incredible film experiences you could ever hope to have and gives me huge faith that real film making isn't dead.4 out of 15 found this helpful.

"A brilliant film that some may find ""boring""viktorrudik22 July 2023Nolan's dialogue is always intriguing, and it is probably the best it ever was in Oppenheimer. However, heavy dialogue films may not be someone's ""Cinematic experience"", and therefore I would advise some individuals to watch the film at home.The film does it's best to make the audience understand at least the basics of what Oppenheimer is working on, however the sound mixing (as usual) sometimes overshadows the conversation, potentially leaving some audience members confused.However I was interested throughout the entire 3 hours, as a lover of cinema, the topic and the historical period, this was a pleasure to watch.3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Nolan's best film without a doubt!neilbowers22 July 2023It has taken me 24 hrs to calm down after watching the amazing film Oppenheimer. To put it bluntly it is quite simply mesmorising from start to finish and the hours just fly by.At the end of the film I have never seen an audience with shock on their faces at what they've just witnessed and people just sat in their seats for 5 minutes before saying anything.It took me and my son 20 minutes to speak to each other as we were taking in the film and everything that we'd just witnessed on the screen and we're still talking about it now it was that good.Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his life as Oppenheimer who was chosen to lead the Manhatten Project and then haunted by what he'd just achieved once the bomb had gone off.Robert Downey Jr has also given the performance of his career and if he doesn't scoop the Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars nextt year then it'll be a tragedy. The last 45 minutes of the film is the best i've ever seen him act.The supporting cast are just as good and really makes the film. Emily Blunt was great as his wife. Florence Pugh as his lover. Rami Malek as phyisacist Hill, Jason Clarke who's character interrogated Oppenheimer all worthy of a mention.The tension that built up to when the bomb first exploded is something i've never experienced before in a film. You really thought that it had failed and were williing it to succeed.The seeing Murphy playing the haunted Oppenheimer in the second half was just something else.Quite simply amazing and this is a film i'd advise everyone to watch in IMAX if you can but it will still blow you away.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"And the oscar for the best actor goes to Cillian Murphylamajoseph-9347121 July 2023I recently watched the movie, and it's yet another masterpiece from Nolan. Although I saw it in a regular theater since we don't have an IMAX in our country, I was still deeply moved by what I experienced during the 3-hour film. I can only imagine how incredible it must have been for those who saw it in its intended format. Murphy's on-screen presence was never in doubt, and Cillian's portrayal finally showcases what a great actor he truly is. Nolan's promise to show everything through Oppenheimer's eyes was brilliantly captured, especially through Cillian's expressive and captivating eyes. His performance made a lasting impression on me. Robert displayed not only his star power but also his exceptional acting skills, delivering one of the most memorable performances in the second half of the movie. As expected from Nolan, this film sets a new milestone. The move had an every element served to the viewers. It surpassed my already high expectations, thanks to the remarkable cast, compelling story, stunning cinematography, and Nolan's dedication. I feel fortunate to have witnessed this epic film, and I believe both Cillian and Robert deserve Oscars for their outstanding performances.

"Strong middle, first and third acts are a borematt-2763422 July 2023Oppenheimer tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), creator of the Atomic bomb and the role he played in WWII. Whilst I wasn't familiar with his backstory, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about.Cast wise, it was packed! However maybe too star-studded to the point where I found myself questioning why certain big-name actors were involved in the film given how little screen time they had. Florence Pugh's character was unnecessary, and whilst she may have meant a lot to Oppenheimer, they could have just referenced her instead. Whilst I personally found Cillian Murphy to be emotionless and monotone, I'm not familiar enough with the real life Oppenheimer to know if that was accurate or not.Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Have strong performances, and Josh Hartnett deserves a special mention for not aging a day since 1998.It's a long film, and there was a lot of dialogue. During some scenes, I felt like I was in a science lecture and had to try not to doze off, and as for the timeline, it was a bit confusing with black-and-white scenes and coloured ones representing various times that didn't make sense.There's no doubting that this film is great, however I just don't think I'm the type of person who would appreciate it in its finest.31 out of 45 found this helpful.

Mediocre and Meanderingjojunno26 July 2023This movie pretends to be clever and artistic but in reality it's just a meandering bloated effort. The cast is wonderful and their performances do have merit there's no question about that. The fault is the story itself. You get the feeling that Christopher Nolan is such a big time director that no one around him has the guts to tell him no. When you surround even the most talented people with Yes Men the result is often inferior. Such is the case with this movie. The story is told through semi flashbacks and a jumping time narrative. What results is unsatisfying and what is seen has very little depth. They try to paint two historical figures back and forth as flawed protagonist yet fail in the delivery.91 out of 162 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A Long Slog Through History, But Blows Up The Quality Of the Genrergkarim21 July 2023LIKES:The Presentation: -Oppenheimer had a lot happen in his life, and this movie does its best to capture it without being too historical -Nolan takes the underlying a story, a case, and uses it as a guiding line that helps tie together to the big parts and summarize his life. It works, and presents the evidence in this visual style and storytelling that works.-There is some Hollywood mixing that might stretch the truth, but it's balanced enough that I can't say it was annoying in conveying the struggles of this time period.-The result is a historical biography that moves, very important for a three hour period, and found myself engaged to listen to the tales of the father of quantum physics in America.The Acting: -No surprise, this is going to be a contender for best acting, and rightfully so given the performances presented in this movie.-Every single person, big or small, has this atmosphere that works. It blends Hollywood dramatic theater with biography and conveys relationships, tensions, and dynamics that are closer to the pulse of reality than some other dynamics.-The tension of the case is conveyed in everyone, and I loved this buildup of so many sides on this issue and it worked well.-Damon is great, his range of acting continues to impress me and the way he has such control over character nuances. This pushed him to several different levels and found his engagement and evolution, quite awesome.-Blunt started out okay for me, one of my top actresses feeling a little sidelined and conveying an okay character. The later acts show her style though and I loved watching this woman deliver these lines and emotions with such a top notch level of acting that spices up acts 3 and 4.-Murphy is the one to keep eyes on though. The man's complexity has evolved way past Red Eye, his conveyance of mannerisms, quirks, obsessions, and genius creepy and yet entrapping. He plays well with everyone, hits these roles of a changing career on high cylinders, and makes a historical character intriguing to look more into.-All in all, this is probably one of the stronger qualities of the film, but there is more to dive into.The Visuals/Cinematography: -Nolan is all about telling stories on a lot of levels, and visual sensations are a key component.-Oppenheimer has fantastic camera work, using angles, lighting, technology, and planning to find the optimum angle to give you the best of the situation.-The changing of filters for various parts adds this nuance that gives subtle changes, adding emotion and messages the likes I did not expect, while keeping me awake.-And the fact that it actively adapts to the character with hyper focus and realism, while still adding touches of grainy visuals of the times, is homage paid well.The Sound: -Thank the Lord, this movie got the sound right and proved editing can still be done.-Nolan's team gives crisp dialog, easy to understand and listen, without getting drowned out by other sounds.-It's the Imax worthy piece of it, the musical scores adding that emotion going to do well on top notch speakers, while the resounding booms and other effects get an added life.-Another level of immersion, the movie really used the budget well to make sure you get all the information you need to follow, and perhaps cast your own vote before the end.The Story Pieces Chosen: -For the most part, Oppenheimer's legacy is tied to the infamous device he crafted, but does that make the most interesting character for all?-Nolan seems to agree it doesn't, and like a good autobiography, finds snippets of his life to ingrain and add a bit more of the ""good stuff"" to enhance the character.-Facets of his life come into play at times, adding extra tests and impasses for him to work around while coordinating so much.-Friendships, relationships, and philosophies conveyed to some extent (though accurately I have no idea) that gives you more than just the science laden man you might think.-It works well for me and should help broaden the audience who will see that movie.-And to have details in all these components, both invention and non-invention, are finding a balance that is surprisingly well, though not as perfect as some might say.The Message: -Outside of Batman, Nolan's work is often very much ingrained in symbolism, morals, and some assessments of characters that works.-And Oppenheimer is loaded with that. A fantastic movie that tests the fortitude of the human emotion and make us question how much we should push the boundaries.-While a tad heavy at times with some lines, the movie is beautifully done to really show the horrors of progress and the good and bads that we must sometimes weigh.-It adds extra edge to the movie, and again gives you that amazing investment for your time, which again works super well with everything.DISLIKES:More Character Balance: -The movie has A LOT of names tied to it, and I won't lie that they aren't all in the movie to the same degree, so don't be surprised if your favorite is on and off in less than 30 minutes.-I mentioned Blunt before, but that evens out, but others, you have to be ready to hold tight to the moments they are in, and dive into books more with their engagement.-I would have liked more balance, integration, conveyance, and a few more moments that I wanted to see were absent. Inclusion would have bloated this film more, but a part of me would have loved more time with several characters.The Presentation Is Odd At First: -Walking into the movie I asked if I had missed something.-The opening is very interesting and you have to be ready for that growth pain of the unique presentation, as you quickly go through his early life during this opening case.-About 20 minutes in, the movie evens out and I was able to understand the presentation style and where we were at. So if you can wade through the confusion at the start, you'll be fine.The Run Time: -It's 3 hours and at times it feels like it when you hit the transition moments that are odd, which slow down the pace.-While most of the stuff is then fine, the last twenty to thirty minutes are the slow parts of the movie and felt the longest. It's important, but... it just feels bloated, long, and very drawn out, that I was ready to go.-True it was hour 5 of a movie, but there were other facets more detail would be welcomed for me, like projects and bombs, instead of seeing this complex endgame. But... it's symbolic and fitting to the story so that helps blunt the time dilation the final effects have.The Audience Entertainment?-Perhaps the last thing to bring to the audience is that this movie requires you to pay attention.-For those looking for entertainment and getting away, without the realism and politics of the world, this movie can be tough to engage with.-The flashbacks and paying attention, keeping track of the names, it's a lot and this might just get in the way of the enjoyment aspect for some, especially when paired with the run time.-Thus, the movie is good and truly an artistic wonder that sticks out from others, but a general audience may be bored and dock scores if they don't know what they are getting.The VERDICT: Oppenheimer may be one of the most artistic and impressive movies of the year if not in a long time. Nolan proves once again that there is a medium of art and entertainment, and I was very engaged for much of this historical drama thanks to his directorial guidance. Fantastic acting with a stunning visual and audio collection bring history to life, and getting us engaged in a turning point of human culture. It's a summary of a tremendous man's life, and though it has some areas I want more of, did a nice job covering bases, with a little Hollywood spectacle added. True, it's a marathon and it isn't easy to hit if you are coming off a long day, one of the worst parts about it, but the pace and content are engaging to keep track of if you are looking for a deeper biographical film. Some character balance and pacing could be a tad smoothed out and cut down sure (maybe a director's cut), and it might not be the entertaining escape, but the movie really is worth the merit and praise for me given what it achieves in this genre. Teaching those lessons, with an engaging cast of characters, at a pace and timing that feels mostly complete without too much bloated feeling. Thus, my scores are:Biography/Drama/History: 9.5 Movie Overall: 9.0, maybe an 8.5 at the least.11 out of 25 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Important film to watch, especially in the new context of UAP disclosureasforrest-28-36847821 July 2023I saw this film in the context of the upcoming UAP/UFO disclosure, which is tightly linked to nuclear proliferation. UAP's have taken an interest in nuclear test sites since their inception, including documented cases of them 'turning off' multiple missile and missile silo's, and I think that this is possible what is being referred to as the chain reaction to change the world.I also watched this movie in terms of AI, we can't stop weaponizing it because otherwise someone else will weaponize it, in turn creating another Cold War in which mutual planetary destruction will help keep nations in check.There really are 2 movies here, the one you watch, and the one that underpins the psychopathic nature of our pathological existence on this planet. This is home, there is no planet B, we really need to stop f-ing it up.The way I look at it, we're monkey's with a big red button that says, 'maybe don't push', but look where that's gotten us.Thank Nolan for making us think and making us truly understand the gruesome nature of the military industrial complex, the machine that's still churning and has now found a place to expend It's soon to expire ammunition in the Ukraine conflict, that's practical.When we're no longer here, it's okay because this space rock will keep on turning, even when the human race is burning.1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"Egregious but not the best Nolan. Cillian Murphy morphs into the character, an amazing cast, brilliant cinematographyAlSoSprach-3923225 July 2023This is a love letter to science and scientists. At times it reminded me of the recurrent joke in ""The Big Bang Theory"" about Howard not being a real scientist since he ""only"" holds a PhD in Engineering. I was a bit disappointed with the sound but it might be an artistic choice. Do words, does dialogue really matter when you are retelling how the fear of violence from one side pushed the other to unleash the most deadly and brutal attack on Japan. This is a well written movie though the ending is disappointingly cliche for a Nolan screenplay. Around the two hour mark. It felt like it was getting boring. It might benefit from some cuts. I would recommend it in a double bill with ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"".2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Thought-provoking filmdeckkerdinesh22 July 2023Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that delves into the complex life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist often referred to as ""the father of the atomic bomb."" This haunting and thought-provoking film masterfully captures a pivotal shift in human consciousness over the course of three gripping hours. As a drama that explores the themes of genius, hubris, and the consequences of individual and collective errors, it immerses viewers in the turbulent journey of Oppenheimer, whose research and development of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki forever changed the world.4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Brilliantly acted, filmed, written, edited, and delivered.walshbd-0056921 July 2023I was very slightly cautious about this movie after Dunkirk disappointed, but Nolan once again proves that film an outlier in his quest to deliver masterpiece after masterpiece of cinema.""Oppenheimer"" does not disappoint the viewer at all. Cillian Murphy delivers his finest onscreen performance of his career, one that should undoubtedly draw multiple nominations and awards of the highest order. The same could be said of the entire tremendously put together ensemble cast.Forget the awards however, if they come they come. With or without them this film stands on its own as arguably the greatest film of the 2020's so far, and it very well might maintain that status.I didn't even see the film in IMAX (due to the horrible availability of the format) and the visual and sound were incredible, and I could feel the force it provided throughout the film in my seat as Nolan intended even in a regular cinema.5 out of 11 found this helpful.

"Cinema Personified: Incredible Moviecinemapersonified29 July 2023Rating: 9.6 Overall, a modern masterpiece that transcends the biopic as Nolan delivers a masterclass in direction, writing, and acting (with Cillian Murphy delivering a career-defining performance) as the movie is breathtaking from top to bottom with how it uses many different elements to help share its true message about the horrors of one's creation (and the implication it may have on the future).Brilliant Direction (The most mature storytelling Nolan has ever displayed as he weaves and controls all the scenes on both a macro and micro-scale to drive the story forward to show his message; this was the Nolan has ever done in getting the most out of his actors as the acting down the cast is amazing to where there are so many actors that have their best performance with this movie; has a more palatable interpretation of his signature Nolan style as he makes the audience think but in a way that they can understand (even if another viewing is needed to provide more clarity)), Incredible Acting (Incredible to Brilliant from Cillian Murphy (A career-defining performance as he truly embodies the role of Oppenheimer and is the real lightning rod for other actors to work off of as his presence really drives the performance of others and moves the story forward), Great to Incredible from Emily Blunt (Plays her role very well as she portrays the trauma and troubled relationship she has with her husband very well, showing the weight of him being passed onto her as the movie goes on), Great from Matt Damon (Plays his role very well and works off of Cillian to help drive the development of the Manhattan Project forward, really acts as the moral bridge between the government and the scientists), Great to Incredible from Robert Downey Jr. (Plays a very multi-dimensional role very well as his polished performance shows the cunning nature politicians can have as they try to be two-faced), Great from Florence Pugh (Does a Great job with the short time she is given as her chemistry with Murphy shows the effort Jean's relationship had on Oppenheimer), Great from Josh Hartnett (My favorite performance out of the secondary cast as his charm really brings personality into the movie that is filled with monotonous scientists), Very Good from Casey Affleck (Given very little screentime but does a very good job in building tension between Murphy in his scenes), Very Good from Rami Malek (A key performance in the movie as he does so much with very little given as he really comes to play in the final moments of the movie), Very Good from Kenneth Branagh (Uses a lot of his experience to play this role as he does well in playing the Dane that has an impact on Oppenheimer's career), Good from Benny Safdie (Kinda the most inexperienced performance of the whole movie but he does a good job in holding his own and building a conflicting relationship with Oppenheimer), Very Good from Jason Clarke (Plays one of the true antagonists of the movie very well as he is a driving presence in the security hearings), Good to Very Good from David Krumholtz (The comedic presence of the movie as he does try to make jokes throughout the movie (the only issue is that the movie is moving so fast there is no time to let the jokes stay and marinate with the audience)), Very Good to Great from Tom Conti (Embodies Albert Einstein very well and it feels like he was perfectly cast as his chemistry with Murphy and his delivery helps show the relationship Oppenheimer had with Einstein), Very Good from Alden Ehrenreich (A surprisingly very good performance from a Nolan composite character as his performance is the real moral lense the audience has to look into the whole situation), Very Good from the rest of the cast (This is an understatement with how good the cast was there is no one bad performance in the entire cast, which is incredible given how deep it is)), Incredible Story (An incredibly dense story that crams many moments in Oppenheimer's life into the film, but uses pace and runtime to make it seem like it may be too short at points as all the story points connect and drive the narrative forward; it is also great to see that they not only spend a lot of time on the Manhattan Project but the aftermath too as that is where the real message of the movie lies; The non-linear storytelling was an homage to Nolan's first break Memento as it helps with showing the consequences of the Manhattan Project), Brilliant Screenplay (One of the best screenplays I have ever witnessed in that the dialogue is so natural yet profound as actors can converse with each other with ease and it is embedded with symbols meant to tell the story; the symbolism is incredibly profound and some of the best I have ever seen in a movie as there are many symbols throughout the movie to help show the message it is trying to present; one of the best uses of foreshadowing I have ever seen as a second watch shows how hesitant the scientists were in creating the bomb given the implications it may have on humanity), Incredible Score (Incredibly complements the movie well and is used very well to build emotion and create pace and tension throughout), Incredible to Brilliant Cinematography (The mix of IMAX cameras with large format 70 MM cameras shows the grandeur of the operation and how larger than life the project was (as well as the aftermath); the mix of color and black-and-white help show different perspective and lenses throughout the movie), Great Sound (The sound editing was incredible as the sounds they used to create the explosions (and the lack of sounds at some point) help build tensions throughout the movie; the mixing of dialogue was an improvement from the previous Nolan movies but it still is an issue as there are some moments were the dialog is hard to hear), Incredible Editing (The cuts were incredibly fluid and some of the best work I have ever seen as they were so mesmerizing the watch on the big screen), Incredible to Brilliant Visual Effects (Some of the best effects work I have ever seen as the use of practical effects over CGI show the capabilities filmmakers have without the use of expensive technology), Great Production Design (This is specifically for Los Alamos as they did a great job in building a makeshift town), Very Good Costumes (The costume work for Oppenheimer is iconic and will be a big part of pop culture for years to come), Plot Structure was very unique and non-linear as Nolan takes a page out of Memento to use a non-linear structure to tell the narrative (and I am a big fan of this as it helps show the effects the Manhattan project has on the future and implications it has on the scientific and American community), Pacing was incredibly fast as the movie flies by its long runtime to fit in as much story as it can (this is neither really a positive nor a negative as there is nothing that could be cut from the movie), Climax was incredible as the movie really culminates to this moment (and this is done very well given how the movie jumps between time periods to help the audience holistically know the bigger picture), Tone was a culmination of a war bio-pic/courtroom-drama/grand epic as Nolan uses his signature style to take the best elements of all three to help establish a very unique tone, Saw in IMAX 70 MM and it really is an experience in itself.1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Truly Epicbo_w27 July 2023Nolan wastes none of the viewers time in throwing you into J. Robert Oppenheimer's world. Epic masterpiece. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Are the standouts. Along with Hoytema's cinematography and Göranssons spine-shaking score. The use of the black and white IMAX film is masterful. Although it is three hours, so, make sure your attention span is long and your brain is switched on. Pacing thought was not an issue due to the unbelievable tension. Nolan may just beat his ""not being able to write characters"" allegations. Though Oppenheimer is a real human which makes it easier. Watch this.4 out of 6 found this helpful.

"OscarHeimer For 2023!KFstudios200923 July 2023J. Robert Oppenheimer was an american theoretical-physicist that was the main boss of The Manhattan Project. He worked on the atomic bomb that could stop the wars between 1939 to 1949. This movie was about Oppenheimers story and life, and how the atomic bomb changed the world forever. Oppenheimer was the worlds savior, but also the killer of a thousand people, innocent and not. It was a very well movie, and showed Oppenheimers moral thinking and how he made the bomb.I was really satisfied about this movie. 3 hours was not bad, for what they were going to show, and I wasn't bored any minute. The sound effects in this movie made the atmosphere very good, and the music was perfectly made for what the scene was showing. Great written and directed by Christopher Nolan, that have directed The Dark Knight and Interstellar. The casting was good also, with Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon and Rami Malek.The moral is very clever and it is also like a warning. That a bomb like that should not be made, and what the consequences can be for making something like that. And Oppenheimers look at the end of the movie, a look of eternity in destruction and madness. That look is something you are going to remember.I did not see it in IMAX, like it was filmed in, I have heared that it is very good in it, but if you watch it in normal 2D I guess it is also good and I recommend to watch this movie anyway.

"Important, well shot and brilliantly acted.bcummi22 July 2023The only downfalls of Oppenheimer come in some of the editing (please editors, let some of these moments breathe) and the near constant score. Some more times of quietness would be good. Otherwise, a terrific watch and a movie future generations should see.The entire cast provide meaningful, emotional and genuine performances. Cillian Murphy is incredible in the lead, giving us a true anchor for our journey into the world of atomics and quantum physics. The cinematography is incredible, depicting the scope and grandeur Christopher Nolan is known for. The sound design too was incredible, all sounding authentic and perfectly matched to what was on screen.2 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Once in a lifetime movieseratmahmudsaad21 July 2023Definitely one of the best movies I've ever watched. The soundtrack in Nolan's movie is always the best, same for this movie. The way the scenes were arranged made me go deep into the plot. All the cast members were also at their best in acting, particularly Cillian Murphy. I hope he wins academy award as the best actor for this work. Some people might say the movie was too long for them, but I think each and every scene was made to be as short/fast paced as possible. If this movie were made shorter than this, it won't be as good as it is now. I will definitely suggest watching the movie if you can. During watching the movie if you think it's too long, just hold on your patience. If you can't keep your patience, good movies are not for you.2 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Holds your breath, Cillian Murphy is SPECTACULARalessandragarrido21 July 2023The movie kept me on my toes the whole time. Although its long I had never the feeling that the movie drags on but rather than it took its time in the crucial moments and lets you hold the breath with the main characters true some intense occasions. While I understand some critics saying that it should evolve more around Oppenheimer itself and that the movie is trying to be more ""clever"" than it is with its time jumps, I felt that this was one of the movies great advantages.It's like watching three different movies in one. But in the end it is masterful composed to one spectacular experience. You see kind of a biopic of Oppenheimer himself through his younger years which is told in retrospective through his interrogation which channels in a politic thriller. And you see the happening of the trinity test through the perspectives of different characters that were involved.Unlike other Nolan films you never need to wonder at which point in time the story is cause its quite clear through the movie - thankfully so.Cillian Murphy is spectacular in carrying the emotions which Oppenheimer must have went through and is aided by an insanely talented cast.While the film might not be for everyone it is absolutely worth watching if you'r ready to let it be what it is and just want to take part in a moment of history that changed the world.10 / 10.4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Tick Tick Boommattclap2823 July 2023Christopher Nolan has delivered yet another cinematic masterpiece with this dark, poignant and powerful biopic of deeply flawed yet brilliant mind. Using Kai Bird's book ""American Prometheus"" as a platform, Nolan leaves the audience contemplating Robert's motivation as an American icon or Anti hero.As J. Robert Oppenheimer and his contemporaries are questioned in relation to his loyalty to his country and Soviet communist ties, we are transported to the turmoil of the professional and private life of Oppenheimer and the mind that would change the world.There are standout performances everywhere, most notably Robert Downey Jnr and of course Cillian Murphy, who could be knocking the door on an oscar nod. Using no CGI also adds to the films authenticity. This is just one of those cinematic moments despite it's length, is simply brilliant.2 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Peak Nolan but what's with the sound?vadim-berman24 July 2023This is how to make a biopic of a complex historical figure without boring the audience! Oppenheimer is my most favourite Nolan's movie so far.The chemistry between the actors is unbelievable, and the visuals are stunning. It's not just wide open spaces of New Mexico, but even elementary particles when Oppenheimer talks about them.I have to say that after the first part where everyone was a Marxist intellectual, the military were a welcome change. The secondary characters are as memorable as the leads. Everyone praises Murphy's performance for a good reason, but Matt Damon's Groves steals the show as a reluctant bridge between the two worlds on a cat-herding assignment gambling an enormous amount on money in the middle of a war. Brief but ominous appearance of Casey Affleck's Boris Pash is probably one of best parts of the movie. Also memorable, even if small, is Tom Conti's Einstein, with his bit of wisdom, and President Truman, played by unrecognizable Gary Oldman.One gripe I'm sure I'm not the only one having: after Tenet, you'd think Nolan would fix his sound problems. Most of the time the dialogue is audible, but there are still parts where I caught myself thinking, ""what did he just say?""1 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"One of the greatest biopics ever made.dishuwalker24 July 2023""OPPENHEIMER"" is undoubtedly a huge cinematic achievement. Christopher Nolan perfectly tells the tale of the father of the atomic bomb and puts the audience in his mind.Cillian Murphy absolutely nails it. 10 perfect casting and also very intensely acted. He shall take home the Oscar for the best actor. Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a compelling performance as Lewis Strauss and has outdone himself too.It is a dense, dialogue-driven 3 hour film, but I was NEVER bored, even once. It is perfectly paced and kept me hooked right till the end. Masterclass at editing.Nolan also nailed the horrifying imagery and the realization of the true impact of the bomb. It would be nicer if there was more of that imagery. That said, the horrifying images really DO horrify you. Absolutely scarring experience. The rise of tension till the detonation of the bomb and the silence that follows, absolutely heart-pounding.Ludwig Goransson outdoes himself in the music department. I never felt the absence of Hans Zimmer, which says a lot.Absolutely breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema. Probably his best work yet. I was thoroughly impressed at how they recreated the detonation without CGI. Also the scenes where Oppenheimer hallucinates are absolutely a masterclass at cinematography - absolutely horrifying images.My only complaint with the film is that I expected a little of those absolutely stunning imagery instead of dialogue. At times, the film becomes overly dialogue-driven.This film definitely deserves Best Actor, Director, Original Score, Cinematography and Editing at the Oscars next year.2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"Excellent Chemistry of Plot and Fandom!sopmaker21 July 2023""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary piece of cinema that showcases the brilliance of Christopher Nolan's direction and the exceptional performance of Cillian Murphy. Nolan's intelligent filmmaking demands the audience's full attention, weaving narratives and time periods seamlessly to tell the captivating story of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing, earning him an Oscar-worthy performance as he navigates the complexities of this historical figure.Nolan's non-sequential storytelling style adds depth and intrigue to the narrative, immersing us in Oppenheimer's life, successes, and personal struggles. The film's runtime of three hours flies by, thanks to Nolan's expert pacing and the engrossing plot. The director's commitment to practical effects heightens the tension during pivotal moments, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.Supporting actors, including Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, deliver powerful performances, adding layers to the film's exploration of Oppenheimer's relationships and choices. Each character represents significant aspects of his life, making us question the price of scientific advancements during wartime.Nolan deftly explores the moral conflicts that shaped Oppenheimer's legacy, humanizing him beyond the label of ""the father of the atomic bomb."" The film delves into the consequences of his decisions and the burden he carried throughout his life. It successfully portrays Oppenheimer as a multi-faceted figure, neither a hero nor a villain but a flawed human whose actions changed the world forever.""Oppenheimer"" is not your typical biopic; it challenges the audience to ponder the ethical complexities surrounding the development and use of nuclear weapons. Nolan's direction and Murphy's performance make this historical figure relatable and thought-provoking. The film's brilliance lies in its ability to entertain while sparking meaningful discussions about the consequences of scientific discoveries and the impact of personal choices on a global scale.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a captivating and intellectually stimulating cinematic experience. Nolan's artistic vision, coupled with Cillian Murphy's remarkable acting, elevates this film to the pinnacle of biographical storytelling. It serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of responsible decision-making and the enduring effects of our actions on the world. A must-watch for film enthusiasts and history buffs alike, ""Oppenheimer"" exemplifies the finest form of filmmaking that both educates and entertains its audience.4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"superior filmmaking and historical storytellingferguson-622 July 2023Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.Prepare yourself. At a full three hours in length, Nolan's film is a hefty undertaking for viewers. It demands full focus and attention to details and nuance, as you spend significant time listening to brilliant men talk amongst themselves. Nolan adapted the screenplay from the 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer"", written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherman. The end result is a film centered on complex physics and mathematics, yet presented in a simplified manner such that it's much more a character study than a science class. The key is what characters say to each other, how they say it, and how they debate and rationalize the morality of the objective ... building a bomb designed to kill people.The morality of The Manhattan Project is under the microscope here, as is the motivation and concern of Oppenheimer. We get some early background establishing him as an upcoming mind in the world of physics from his academic stops around the globe. Some know Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders"" or as Scarecrow in Nolan's Batman movies. I'd also recommend a couple of Murphy's underrated gems: FREE FIRE (2016) and RED EYE (2005). It's hard to overstate how spot on Murphy is as Oppenheimer. He lost weight for the role and captures the distinctive movements and speech patterns, as well as the familiar poses and deep-in-thought eyes. We never once question whether this is Oppenheimer, the leader of the science team at the Los Alamos Lab and the Father of the Atomic bomb ... the one who ""sees beyond the world we live in."" Once Major Groves (Oscar winner Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to run and assemble the great scientific minds, the obvious question to those involved is ... even if we can create this bomb, should we do it? This weighs heavily on Oppenheimer - a man so engulfed by science that his haunting visions are that of atoms and particles and experimental reactions (perhaps a bit too heavy in the first act). Groves is the military leader of the project and the liaison between the scientists, the military, and the government. It's also clear that while Oppenheimer's brilliance is recognized and necessary to the project, almost no one outside of the scientists trusts him. This is where antisemitism and fears of communism arise. Oppenheimer was Jewish and, though he never joined the communist party, was associated with many who did. This included his love interest, Psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (the fabulous rising star Florence Pugh), his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold).The teamwork and stress involved with building the bomb in Los Alamos is conveyed as rooms full of brilliant minds determine the future path of the country and the world. This culminates in the stunning sequence of The Trinity Test near Alamogordo. A blending of complete silence, along with spectacular sound and light, is truly a technical highlight of the film. The initial celebration of success initially overshadows the true meaning ... the bomb is now ready for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing two hundred thousand people and essentially ending WWII, less than four years after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese (never mentioned here).The bombings are heard via radio news reports, and it's at this point where the weight of what the scientists have done is fully realized. Oppenheimer became a national hero and his Time Magazine cover proves it. A meeting with President Harry S Truman (Oscar winner Gary Oldman sporting a Missouri accent) doesn't go well, as Oppenheimer is introduced to political gamesmanship, something he would face even more directly in the near future. Lewis Strauss (Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr) is a key player as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, and through him, we witness ego, ambition, and petty behavior that leads to a level of vindictiveness typically only seen at the junior high level.Multiple timelines are covered. There is the background information on Oppenheimer's early years, his well-rounded academia, his love life (lives), his building of the Los Alamos lab team, the overseeing of the bomb development, his time as a hero, the later backroom kangaroo court designed to disgrace him, and Strauss' Senate Confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce. All of these tie together, and it's those final two that make up the last act of the film - giving us a taste of just how nasty politics was 70 years ago (not unlike these days).Nolan has assembled a deep cast with numerous Oscar winners and a roster of talented actors. Among the familiar faces not already named above are: Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh as Danish Physicist Neils Bohr, Oscar winner Rami Malek as experimental physicist David Hill, Oscar winner Casey Affleck as Military security advisor Boris Pash, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Benny Safdie, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, Scott Grimes, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, James Urbaniak, Olivia Thirlby, James Remar, and (Nolan regular) David Dastmalchian.The film is a historical biopic and also an unconventional thriller. Is this about unparalleled advancement in science or is it about the moral dilemma of mass destruction and death? Politics, military, ego, power, science, love, revenge, and redemption are all displayed as Oppenheimer struggles with the power he has created and the lack of power in how it's used. My favorite line in the film is aimed at Oppenheimer when someone informs him that he's now ""not just self-important, but actually important."" The stakes are clear during the test when it's stated that there is a ""near zero"" chance of destroying the world.Cillian Murphy is a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination, and his performance mesmerizes us. It's nice to see Robert Downey Jr remind us of his true talent, and he should be rewarded with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, in the only two substantive women roles, should both receive consideration as well. Pugh's role is limited but memorable, while Blunt shines in her best scene during the security hearing.Christopher Nolan has delivered near perfection in technical movie-making, and on top of that, the story and characters are real life, and the performances are top notch. His use of Black & White film for Strauss' perspective allows the viewer to differentiate the Oppenheimer viewpoint. Impressively, while there are some visual effects, Nolan has stated that no CGI was used in the film, and that's most evident in the relatively short closing credit roll - where we typically get dozens if not hundreds of technical experts listed. Ludwig Goransson's (Oscar winner for BLACK PANTHER) score packs an emotional punch, and Jennifer Lame's editing is excellent and vital. Lastly, cinematographer (and regular Nolan collaborator) Hoyte Van Hoytema drives home the power of smart men in a room, as well as the devastation of the bomb test. This is excellent filmmaking and a reminder that the only thing we love more than lifting new heroes onto the pedestal of worship is tearing down those same heroes with a dose of humility. These types of movies rarely get produced these days, so here's hoping enough people go back to the theater to see it to inspire more filmmakers to take a shot.Opened nationally July 21, 2023.32 out of 62 found this helpful.

There were story elements in the first half that could have easily been left out, there was no need to make this movie 3 hours long. It should have been about quality, not quantity. However with all that said, the last hour of this movie rescued what could have been a disaster. It was brilliant, dramatic and intense, Nolan at his best in my opinion.
